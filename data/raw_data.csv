9t0gqz,"Hi, I wish to share my journey of getting disciplined. I hope you will take something away from this :). I would like to mention that I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me for any grammar and/or spelling mistakes.

TLDR; Build positive habits on a foundation of willpower, not motivation.

Start reading non-fiction and apply it in your life. Work on your physiology, it should be the foundation for productivity and discipline.

Lessen the amount of superstimuli in your life to get more dopamine (motivation).

Flow activities should be the goal in life, not mind numbing pleasure.

Start a bullet journal where you color code all activities you do each day positive or negative.

It all started when I realized I had hit rock bottom. I was getting up at 3pm everyday. Only ate junkfood, lay in bed watching YouTube and smoking a lot of weed. My room was always a complete mess. I completely disregarded my study while I was living of a study loan. Every night I would hang out with a friend who would do the same and we'd smoke weed and watch screens until about 5 am. It really was rock bottom. This went on for a long time until I saw I had to change my life.

# HABIT BUILDING

I read a book called The Slight Edge. The idea of the book was that with consistent, incremental improvement, anyone could reach anything. It also debunked the idea of a 'quantum leap', which at first I believed in. I liked the idea and started implementing it to form positive habits in my life. I started with nofap, meditation, reading, cleaning and some more. I made a lot of mistakes when I first started out. So some advice on habit building I have accumulated is this:

DON'T TRUST MOTIVATION. Motivation is good if it's there but it shouldn't be the foundation of the habits you create. Why? because motivation isn't always there, and when it's gone you also lose the habits that you build on top of it. I experienced this a lot of times. I would have a streak of 100+ days meditation, miss 3 days and completely give up until I had the motivation again to start over.

So how can I build habits then? Do it based on willpower. The big difference is not to say to yourself ""I'm gonna read 20 pages every day because I'm so motivated to gain knowledge."" But that you say ""I'm going force myself to start reading everyday because I will have enough willpower to always do that.""

The key is that if you make the requirement so small that you can always do it, you will never fail. So doing for example 1 pushup everyday. You will never fail that requirement. But if you have very little motivation one day and think about doing 20 pushups, it just seems intimidating and you don't do it.

Some people might say ""only starting to read or doing 1 push up will never get me anywhere."" And I agree, but the thing is that you can do more. And you will usually do more. Once you forced yourself, with willpower, to get into push up position and do 1 push up, you'll probably think ""I can do one more, and one more"" and so on. Same for reading, once you've forced yourself to sit in a chair with a book and started reading, you wont stop after just 1 word. You will do a lot more than the initial requirement more times then not. It will also give you a sense of ""I did this"". Especially if your requirement is, say, 1 push up, and you do 10. You will have done 9 extra. As opposed to when you require yourself to do 20 and do 10. You will have done 10 too little.

Try it right now, force yourself on the ground to do one push up. I'm sure you have the willpower to do that.

The key is to make the requirement so small you will never fail it. Build the habit on a foundation of willpower, if motivation comes along, that's great.

# READING

The one habit that has done the most for my life is to read non-fiction. I bought an e-reader and started to read daily. I recommend buying an e-reader a lot. Here are some of the benefits:

\- Very portable, whenever I'm in public transport I pull it out and read some pages.

\- Buying books is instant and you can read anything you'd like

\- If you have little money there are a lot of places where you can download ebooks for free

\- It has a backlight, so you can read in your bed, lying on your side, in the dark. Most come with blue light filters as well.

Some of the benefits of reading non-fiction

\- You can learn directly from great people

\- There are books on anything that you find interesting (for me it's psychology)

\- There are a lot of self-help books on the market that will give you advice that you can practically apply in your life.

I'm sure there are a lot more, but for the sake of not writing a book as a post this will do.

I think the most important thing as a prerequisite for discipline is good physiology. If you aren't feeling good it's hard to do things that would count as disciplined behavior. So that's why I would recommend reading some books about physiology.

Books that have had a profound impact on my life are; Mini habits, Meet Your Happy Chemicals, The HeartMath Solution, The Willpower Instinct, Cupid's Poisoned Arrow, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and Awareness Through Movement.

If your read all these books you will learn; how to create healthy habits in your life without making it hard; how your brain chemicals work; how to instantly lower stress and deal with negative thought and emotion, how willpower works, why it matters and how to get more of it; how orgasm induces neurochemical brain changes for 2 weeks and how it's evolutionary designed to break romantic relationships; what a flow experience is, and why it should be the goal for all activities in life to turn into one; that everyone stops progressing in the most basic things like breathing, posture etc. because only the minimal in life is needed to get on, it also provides lessons on how to improve these parts of life.

Gaining knowledge in this field will give you the ability to make the changes in your life that will benefit your overall feeling. Feeling good overall, in your body and mind, is required for doing productive things.

# DOPAMINE

I'm a psychology student so when I got into self help I was naturally interested in the brain's place in self improvement.

Dopamine is the key player here. Most people think dopamine is responsible for 'pleasure'. This is a big misunderstanding. Dopamine is actually responsible for 'wanting' and motivation.

When the dopamine part of the brain was first discovered, it was discovered in rats. The researchers hooked up a lever to the rats' dopamine circuit to shock the dopamine circuit (mimicking dopamine release) whenever the rats would pull the lever. The rats soon ignored anything else and only pulled the lever until they died of starvation and fatigue. Next the researchers (this one is a bit cruel) would have 2 levers on the opposite sides of a cage that would produce a 'dopamine hit' if pressed after the other. To make it interesting they put an electrically charged grid in between that would give the rats a painful shock if they walked over it. So now the rats would have to cross the grid every time they wanted another 'dopamine hit'. Shockingly (lol) the rats would run across it until they burned of their legs and couldn't walk anymore. The researchers concluded from these experiments that this dopamine circuit was responsible for creating pleasure. Nowadays this is proved to be wrong and the actual function of the dopamine circuit is believed to be wanting and motivation.

Most things people like to do give a lot of dopamine (much more than anything would have given in nature). Things like watching TV (or netflix), internet, drugs, processed foods, porn, gambling and videogames. Things that give us a lot of dopamine tend to be addicting. No wonder I was only smoking, watching screens and lying in bed when I hit rock bottom.

Now, why should you care? The reason is very simple. Exposure to high dopamine for longer periods of time REDUCES DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. Lower dopamine receptors give you lower motivation, lower concentration and less mental sharpness. With there being a lot of supernaturally high dopamine giving activities and substances available to us we should all be aware in what amount we should consume them. This is the reason why there are more college and university dropouts more than ever before. Why so many people are unhappy at work. And why there are more cases of depression than ever before (depression is linked to lower dopamine).

Big companies know about this and use it to sell us as much as possible and keep them on their platforms for longer. They put the exact amount of sugar in all foods so that we like it the most, they design their platforms so you stay on them a lot (Facebook and Instagram), they implement gambling into games so that we play them more (Fortnite).

So what to take away from all this? Lessen the amount of activities you do each day that give you a lot of dopamine and don't add anything to your life. This will give you a natural amount of dopamine receptors again and will make it a lot easier to stay concentrated while reading or learning an instrument for example.

# FLOW ACTIVITIES

1 book that has made a profound impact on my life is the book Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience. The idea of the book is that there are certain activities that for which your brain needs 100% of  it's power to be focused on the activity. This is when you reach a 'Flow state'. In this state you lose the idea of the self, you lose track of time and are only focused on the task at hand. For example when you drive somewhere and you get there and don't remember how you got there.

Flow occurs when your skill matches the challenge of the activity. When your skill is too high, you will be bored, when the challenge is too high you will be anxious.

The key idea from this book, for me, was the difference between pleasure and enjoyment. Pleasure activities are ones that give the high amount of dopamine. Whereas enjoyable activities also give dopamine, but also make you better at the task and will often produce a state of Flow. Enjoyment produces growth, pleasure does not.

I think that any activity in life that is not a pure pleasure activity can be made into a flow activity. It's one of my goals in life to fill my day with enjoyable activities. It made me realize I wanted to fill my day with making music and reading, not with smoking and watching TV.

# JOURNALING

One of the best habits I have build is journaling. More specifically bullet journaling. I'm not sure if this is the official way to do it but this is what I do and what works for me.

People pay coaches a lot of money to do something they can do themselves as well; give feedback. All a coach does is tell you what you've done, and where you can improve. This is something you can do yourself easily by bullet journaling.

My method: I have a simple notebook where I use the left and right page for 1 day. In the morning I write down some things I want to do that day on the left page. If there are things I wanted to do yesterday I write them down for today. I also write a bit about how I feel. Recently I've been doing some affirmations as well on that page. You can skip this entire left page, I personally like it, but I can understand how it's a bit much for some people. You could also experiment with it and change it up how you like it.

The real magic (and the reason I made the coach analogy) is on the right page. Here is where I write down every influential activity I do. I won't write down things like 'have breakfast' or 'short chat with roommate'. I write down everything that has a positive or a negative meaning (some things are neutral like doing groceries). Then at the end of the day I will use a marker to color code every activity either green (positive) or red (negative). So for example:

(green) get up at 6am

(green) take a cold shower

(green) meditate

(red) smoke a joint

(red) waste an hour on Netflix

(green) go to school

(red) hangout with X toxic friend and drink beer

I hope you see what I meant with the coach analogy now. You will get a lot of feedback on what you do each day. When I first started doing this I was shocked by how much red activities I had and  made it a mission to get more green activities in there. It was slow progress but steadily it got better.

If you don't like the left part of the journaling (which is how most people recommend it), I would advice you to try the right page. If you're gonna do one, it should be the right page. See it as a free life coach.

# SLEEP SCHEDULE

When I was at rock bottom my schedule was the furthest away from perfect that it could possibly be. One of the first things I changed that lasted was my sleeping schedule. I was done waking when it's almost dark already and still being tired. Also I noticed that everything I did in the late evening wasn't productive (or even counterproductive) like watching screens and doing drugs

There are good reasons to wake up early (5-6-7 AM). The best sleep you can get is the sleep between 10 and 12. If you're still awake at 00:00 you will produce cortisol and adrenaline to keep you awake. This isn't healthy. Good sleep improves cognitive function, vitality and motivation by a lot. There are many more benefits to a good sleeping schedule, and I think it's well known that it's a lot better. However most people think it's hard to change their schedule.

It's not. This is how you do it;

\- Set your alarm at your goal wake up time (EG 6 am)

\- When it goes, get out of bed, immediately eat breakfast

\- Don't sleep the rest of the day

\- Make sure you stop all screens by 9:30 and are in bed before 10:00

\- Set the alarm again, you will most likely wake up before it goes.

It's as easy as this, now all you have to do is to stick with it. Start enjoying the vast amount if time you have available in the morning.

1mbhsfy,"For a long time, I was stuck in this cycle where I'd only be productive when I felt like it.

If I was in a bad mood, I'd tell myself to wait until tomorrow. When I was tired, I'd take a Netflix break. If I was stressed about something, I'd procrastinate until my headspace cleared up.

One day, my grandma was watching me complain about how I couldn't get anything done because I was ""too anxious"" about some work project.

She just looked at me and said, ""You know, during the war, we didn't have the luxury of waiting until we felt good to do what needed doing.""

Then she told me something I'll never forget:

**You need to seperate your actions from your feelings!**

She said most people think their feelings and their actions are married to each other. Happy means productive, sad means lazy, scared means stop. But that's just a story we tell ourselves.

""I didn't feel like rationing food or working on the farm. But I did it anyway. Not because I ignored my feelings, but because I did it WITH my feelings.""

When I complained that it's different now, that it's harder to stay disciplined with all the distractions and the flood of choices, she didn't argue with me.

She just nodded and said, ""You're probably right. But here's what I learned: don't lie to yourself by using your feelings as an excuse.

Don't say: ""I'm stressed, so I can't do it.""

She told me to change the narrative and tell myself: ""I'm stressed, that's fine, so I'll do it stressed.""

Now when I catch myself thinking ""I don't feel like working out,"" I flip it to ""I'm unmotivated, so I'll work out unmotivated. What's type of workout can I even do when I'm unmotivated?""

I figured that the problem with discipline is not the doing, it's the starting.

And my grandma's advice made the starting part extremely easy for me.

Today, I actually don't complain about distractions anymore. I use them to reverse-engineer my feelings and to turn them into a booster for action.

Every time I scroll social media mindlessly, I use a few tools (can recommend these [Reddit resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stopscrolling/wiki/index/)) to recognize. Then I reflect on my emotions and what type of action I'm avoiding (work, gym, chores, ...).

Then I close my eyes and hear my grandma. A minute later, my phone is gone.

Absolute legend that lady, really hope I have her for some more years.

# THEORY:

(Long time lurker, but this sub is pretty positive so I feel like I can share)

I had a theory.

The theory was that we are surrounded by information. In the sea of information, if we could sort all the most useful information into one book, we could provide a manual of life changing advice & help into one brief guide.

But how do we organize what is most important?

What better way to advocate for something being useful than an upvote right?

So I decided to find all the top self-help reddit threads of all time and read through all the top posts of this year. Then, I combined all the most common advice into a cheat sheet, with the most common advice prioritized at the top.

My end goal is to one day provide a ""Basic Human Needs"" course, where I could hopefully pass along all the useful advice I've collected from the over 300+ self-help books I've read and (literally) thousands of articles & posts I've combed through over time and form a virtual big brother / virtual mentor created from the internet.

(I never had a father to teach me stuff. Thanks to you all, I actually feel prepared for life.)

\-

# METHOD:

I first went to [http://redditmetrics.com/top](http://redditmetrics.com/top) and combed through the top 800 subreddits that had anything to do with self-help. These include getdisciplined, lifehacks, personalfinance, startup, and lots more.

I then opened up each subreddit, where I sorted by the top posts over the past year, and began to comb through each subreddit for common themes. Initial phases were rather difficult, because I had to type up anything that sounded like it would come up again.

After documenting all the themes, I then grabbed a new document and put together a clean list of all the things that began to repeat.

Anywhere that you see a x2, x3, etc. That is the number of times a concept is repeated almost verbatim in a post. Otherwise, it is ranked by how often the concept was loosely repeated.

I am fully aware that this isn't as scientific as I'd like this to be. I plan to do this again for All-Time, attach the spreadsheet of the data analysis, a list of subreddits analyzed and the posts within. I did not have enough time to do this over the weekend I could dedicate to this project.

**WARNING:** This is a prototype and it's ugly. Also, none of this is my opinion - just others.

# RESULTS:

## Success:

1. Optimism makes people perform better. Most importantly, the optimism that literally anything can be defeated with enough effort. Every obstacle is *merely* a challenge, not a threat. x 8
2. Habits are what form and deform your life. Humans are short-sighted. Build a ritual that will, much like compound interest, build an amazing life. x6  
Working out twice a day for a week won’t do much. But a year could make for a transformation. Failure is not one dramatic fall, but a series of small failures, compounded over a longer period. X 5
3. Scale slowly. An overnight success still had 1 step up goals every hour. A billion dollar company once only had a goal of a million dollars. Set numerous small, achievable, bite sized goals - as opposed to a few, huge chunky goals. X 4
4. Authenticity is king. People enjoy authentic people, respect authentic people and welcome authentic people. x 4
5. Common sense beats all rules, stipulations and otherwise. You likely know most of what you learn, it’s simply being reorganized to fit your mind better. When it’s time to take action, trust that you know what you’re doing and focus solely on moving. x 3
6. Success comes from trying something, failing and modifying the action - Thousands of times. No amount of preparation (beyond the basic) can prepare you for the first day with sharks. ACTION + MODIFICATION = RESULTS x 3
7. Show small amounts of gratitude every day. Make it apart of your ritual. The gratitude forces you to focus on the things you are happy about. Small gratitude is low commitment and high reward. X 2
8. Establish 3 to 20 second barriers between bad habits. Take batteries out the remote. Put junk food in trunk of car. It won’t stop you completely. But it will decrease significantly. Make positive habits easier. Pack a healthy lunch. X 2
9. A huge part of succeeding at something is simply showing up. Even if that means you just walked in the door and back out. If you show up, the math says you’ll succeed, eventually. X 3
10. Go 150% + beyond what you are expected to do. This is a 100% way to gain immediate traction. Applied with consistency can skyrocket results. x 2
11. Practice task isolation. The only thing that matters in that moment is the task at hand. Work on that task only until you are ready to stop. Nothing else matters until. X 2
12. Constantly be evaluating yourself. Every year, every month, week, day, hour. - Do this 100% objectively and healthily. The more you look at yourself objectively and decide what you’re doing right and wrong, the better feedback you can use to improve. X 2
13. If you are always the smartest person in the room, you’re probably in a room full of idiots or you’re lying to yourself.
14. Double down on your strengths. Neutralize your weaknesses. Make them just capable enough to swim still water.
15. Adaptation is the key to survival. You cannot run over a jungle, but with the right small, frequent adjustments, you can run through a jungle.
16. Discipline is not just following a plan when you need a plan, but following the plan when you’ve succeeded. Make a plan and follow it, regardless of your emotions.
17. When you first wake up, try breathing faster and faster until hyperventilation. It makes your body kick into awake mode quickly.
18. Try fasting from a bad habit completely. Replace it with something less bad. Over time, you can replace a lot of small bad habits with less bad habits and get big change.
19. Organization, habits and the process of planning is actually all simply tools to clear space in your brain. You cannot use a car efficiently if it is jammed to the ceiling with clothes and furniture that belong in your house. And the furniture and clothes can’t be used correctly either.
20. Take stock in the understanding that 90% of successful people are doing a lot of hustle underneath the glam and money. They wake up early, they skip parties and they work - A LOT.
21. Automate literally every task you do not enjoy. It will make your life focus on the things you do enjoy.
22. Most habits can be changed by finding the belief rooted to it and finding all the evidence you can to break it. - “The gym is a chore.” \*Watch documentaries about people who love the gym\* ""I love sugary foods"" \*Watch documentaries about sugar causing disease\* - You are what you subscribe to.
23. Tell no one your goals. Talking gives you a rush of endorphins and dopamine. You “dope yourself out” on talking and never get anywhere.
24. No amount of regret can bring back the dead. Love immensely and give your friends and family what they deserve as soon as possible and as often as possible.
25. Chain together successful tasks and create the illustration of commitment, thus reducing your likelihood to miss out. - Crossing off days on a calendar chains a habit and thus reduces the chance to break it.
26. Stage every commitment so you only give what you get back, and scale it slowly. Put in 1 cent, if it gives back 1 cent, then put in 5 cents. If it gives back 5 cents, continue. Never Give 100% to an idea you haven’t tested at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% etc.
27. Never show your cards first in a negotiation. The offer they have in mind may be much higher than you’re thinking.
28. In a dispute, ask for proof of everything. Make the process draining for the other party if you’re in the right and they are forcing you to wade through mud.

## Finance:

1. Every successful person saves money. EVERY. SUCCESSFUL. PERSON. SAVES. MONEY. Save, at the very least, 10%
2. Every successful person invests. Invest in a bank, invest in real estate, invest in yourself. No matter how you invest, it’s the only way to grow. Spend your money on things that grow. - This includes your health.
3. Do not skip on insurance. The peace of mind that disaster will not ruin you is worth the duty paid.
4. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.

## Social:

1. Listen to people. Ask open-ended questions to get someone to talk. Why, what and how questions. To enhance listening, look for a one sentence life lesson to take from every story / interaction. x 4
2. You are upset because no one calls you to do things. So is the person who didn’t call you. Initiate activity. This is a solid way to be invited to more things, meet new people and have fun. X 2  

   1. Group activities are always more comfortable.
   2. Have a specific plan in place of who, what, when, where & why.
   3. Sometimes the event will fall apart. This is common. Do it anyways. It’s worth it.
   4. Social people invite others out when they feel lonely. Antisocial people wait for a phone call. Antisocial people have a higher probability of being lonely.
3. Traveling & expanding your social circle makes you more confident in who you are.
4. Be 10% more excited than the person you are talking to in positive conversations.
5. You have value to add to every interaction. Whether it’s with a CEO or a janitor. No matter your past - If you’ve burned many bridges, at least you had bridges to burn.
6. If 10 people in a row reject you as a friend, that’s only .000000015 percent of the world’s population. You’ve got a whole lot more to choose from.
7. Small talk is the door to deep friendship. You must make small talk first. You first said “Hi” to your significant other, you first had an interview at a company. People need to know you won’t stab them before they want to hang out.
8. Letting go of the thought that people have to like you is the best decision you will ever make. People would have liked or disliked you regardless of how lightly you tread.
9. Talk to people’s emotions. A metalhead and a classical music lover can connect on how emotional they get during a raw, deep piece.

## Health:

1. Get 6-8 hours of sleep. It can cause huge detriments to your wellbeing to get less. X 3
2. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. X 2
3. Sleep is one of the more important aspects of health, right beside nutrition and exercise. Master these three and you are doing well.
4. Optimum sleep temperature is 61-64 degrees F. Optimal sleep warm up is 1 hour before bed to begin process attempting sleep. - No screens, no exercise, no stress.
5. Meditation provides a range of health benefits.
6. Exposure to nature prevented hay fever and other illnesses in cavemen.
7. Stem cells regrow the body.
8. Alcohol consumption linked to many diseases we didn’t think - such as Alzheimer's, Dementia, Cancer, etc. Alcohol companies are funding research to make alcohol okay or “healthy”. X 2
9. Not exercising is worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease.
10. Tobacco use linked to a quarter of a billion life-years lost vs. illegal drugs accounting for only tens of millions.
11. Education linked to better health than income. Intelligent people make smarter health decisions that prevent the need for reactive, potentially too-late healthcare.
12. Dropping smartphones from evening activity led to 93.6% of participants opting to keep their phones off at night. - Increased happiness, focus & wellbeing.
13. Dark chocolate is a superfood. Good for health and mind.

## Business:

1. WHO matters most, then WHY, then HOW, then WHAT, then WHEN. Hire the right people with the right motives who follow a great plan and what you do and when you do it should work out on it’s own. x 2
2. Facebook, Uber, AirBnb, eBay - All got their start connecting two people together who could help each other. None have inventory, shipping centers, etc.
3. Buy low, sell high. Every business is in the business of buying something cheaper than they sell it. Simplify your business by asking what you’re buying for cheap, and selling for more.
4. Personal letters are the only way to get through a noisy world today. Find a way to personalize every communication you send.
5. The product will sell itself. Build a product that people will talk about.
6. Test EVERYTHING. We live in a hyper-feedback world. Run test after test and build on what works. Methodically test every single aspect of your business.
7. “Big Picture” thinkers don’t work well in a startup. You need detail oriented thinkers to calculate every move and thought.
8. Ideas are like treadmills. It can be a catalyst to something great, but will require you to execute methodically and frequently. A treadmill without work is worthless.
9. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.
10. The best marketing is word of mouth. Talk to the loudest birds and get noticed effortlessly.
11. Know your worth. Ask for that raise. It costs money to replace an employee, and it could be a significant amount.

Im not sure if I can post links here, but if someone wants it, I have a printable Google Doc of the cheat sheet. I read it once a week or so.

I also did this with most sold self-help books of all-time if anyone is interested.",r/getdisciplined,[Method] I summarized all the top posts of the top self-help subreddits of all time into a cheatsheet.,7179,0.99
ic70lc,"It sounds simple, but when I realized it - it helped me a lot. I'll try to share it.

The root problem with many productivity issues is being constantly overstimulated.

People often tell ""I was doing nothing the entire day instead of working"" while the truth is that you were not doing anything. You were stimulating your brain all the time using social media or something else.

The message to your brain is simple then: I can be laying all day and still be stimulated. And THIS is why you feel the urge to lay in the bed. It's a cheap way of getting stimulation for your brain. Your brain hates doing nothing.

Try to sit somewhere for an hour or two and do nothing. Put your phone next to you and just look at it.

You will quickly notice that your brain starts to negotiate with your conditions of being stimulated.

At first, it'll just tell ""come on, let's just check Twitter"". Then, it'll start to lower its requirements and at some point, you can feel like on some sort of drugs. You'll want to sing some song, move your legs, whatever. This is the key.

When feeling the urge to procrastinate, I've started to try to put it in a bit different perspective.

Instead of fighting 'do it now' vs 'do it later with my brain, I've told myself 'Ok, Brain, we don't have to do it now. We can sit here the entire day and don't even start doing it. BUT we'll do NOTHING else.'

And this is what started to help me.

With time, I've realized it's hard to do NOTHING, when the brain is stubborn for a long while, as you might have to wash your dishes, etc. So this is fine, but just do something that is not stimulating you. (washing my dishes without music etc. is not stimulating for me).

What I've also noticed is how bad 'infotainment' can be for you. You lay in bed and check some 'nice websites'. You're learning a lot about maths, space, and productivity from youtube, etc. (you might think it's way better than social media).

4xwrut,"Learn to front-load your pain.

That's it. 

If you procrastinate, you're putting off more than your work. You're putting off the *pain.* Right? 

But doesn't it always catch up to you? 

What you have to do is front-load all those yucky crappy feelings. Go ahead and feel it now so you don't have to feel it later. And guess what? If you put it off, it gets amplified. Right now you're dreading doing your homework or writing an article or w/e, but what if you don't do it? And worse, what if you put that stuff off consistently? 

That thing you feel crappy about? That thing you're dreading? That is *exactly* the thing you need to do in order to improve your life. 

It's a sign post. 

Instead of dreading it, go ahead and embrace it. Embrace the yucky feeling and all. If you can do this for three weeks consistently, you will change your life forever. 

If you embrace all that yucky stuff with gusto, your brain will take notice. Your brain is not static. it changes depending on what you focus on. The circuitry in your brain literally changes over time. 

Finally, think of your actions as alchemy. You are taking time and adding energy to it to create a result. If you take action haphazardly, you will have a meh kind of life. 

You *know* you're going to end up  feeling like shit if you procrastinate anyway, so go ahead and do the thing you're afraid to do. If you're going to feel bad either way, you might as well take the action that will improve your life.

1mrsmsh,"People hype discipline like it’s all about waking up at 5 AM, cold showers, grinding like a robot. Tbh, that’s not real discipline, that’s just cosplaying productivity for Instagram. Discipline is doing the stuff you promised yourself you’d do, even when you’re tired, bored, or straight up not in the mood. It’s studying when your brain says scroll, it’s cooking a simple meal instead of ordering junk, it’s closing the gap between what you said you’d do and what you actually do.

The brutal truth is, discipline is boring most of the time. It’s not hype, it’s not motivation, it’s the tiny choices stacked day after day that nobody claps for. That’s why people give up, because there’s no dopamine rush in doing the same thing consistently. But that’s where growth is, fr.

Discipline is not about perfection, it’s about trust. Every time you keep a promise to yourself, you build self-respect. Every time you break it, you train yourself to not believe your own words. And once you stop trusting yourself, it’s game over. That’s why the real flex isn’t a 5 AM routine, it’s being able to say “I’ll do it” and then actually doing it, no excuses.

If you slip up, don’t spiral. The real secret is never missing twice. You miss one workout, fine, but don’t miss the next. You procrastinate one day, fine, but don’t let it turn into a week. Discipline is not about being perfect every single time, it’s about refusing to let your bad days outweigh your good ones.

Fr, once you get this, your whole life changes. You stop living in theory and start living in action. And that’s when you separate yourself from 99% of people.",r/getdisciplined,Discipline is not about waking up at 5 AM. It’s about this brutal truth nobody wants to face.,5571,0.99
a1sa3p,"**1. Breakfast IS NOT the most important meal of the day.**

I trained for the marathon in the mornings and ran for several hours at a time - *without having breakfast*. Fat is our body’s ‘natural’ and preferred source of energy - *not carbs or proteins* \- and this was what ‘fueled’ me on most of my runs.

**2. Life is quite simple.**

Whether it’s running a marathon or going for a 10 minute run, it doesn’t matter. It comes down to the same thing... putting one foot in front of the other.

Showing up. Getting Started. Doing the work.

It’s that simple.

This concept applies to ANYTHING you want to accomplish in life. Break down your goals into the smallest steps possible and just keep taking those steps until you get to where you want go.

**3. Consistency.**

As long as you keep showing up and taking action, you will get better.

It’s a no brainer.

If you want to be a better writer, artist, musician, or athlete, show up - be consistent.

>***""We are what we repeatedly do.""***  
>  
>\-Aristotle

**4. Life is ALL a mental game.**

Your body and feet might be aching with pain as they bitch at you screaming at the top of their lungs telling you to stop and slow down, but if your mind refuses to listen, your body will continue to obey.

>***""When you think you're done, you're only at 40% of your body's capability.""***  
>  
>\-David Goggins, Retired Navy Seal

**5. You only have as much energy as you use.**

The most productive period in my life was when I was training for the marathon. It could have been a coincidence but I highly doubt it reflecting back.

When you can run for 3+ hours in one sitting, I think that makes it much easier to work 3 hours straight as well.

**6. People who love eating really should run (or do any other cardio intensive sport).**

As I was training for my marathon I lived in Chiang Mai, Thailand for a month and I regularly visited the same restaurant to have a feast, especially after my longer runs.

I'd go there and order 3 main meals along with a smoothie.

After several visits, one of the waitresses said I shouldn’t keep eating like this because I would get fat.

Jokes on her, when I left Thailand, I hadn’t even gained a pound. My weight barely fluctuated because when you run a few hours each day… **You can eat A LOT.**

[https://imgur.com/a/axXMk](https://imgur.com/a/axXMk)

**7. Making a** ***real*** **commitment is POWERFUL.**

I’d always wanted to run a marathon but was never into running. I decided to stop saying I would *one day* run a marathon and just go fucking do it.

I Googled for the next local marathon event and signed up for it. On that day, I made a *real* commitment. I was going to finish that marathon no matter what. And that’s seriously all it took.

I found a training program, showed up and followed it to a tee because I was *committed*.

There was no backing out. In my mind I literally could not fathom any other alternative except seeing myself cross that finish line.

**8.Challenging yourself is important.**

I had so much confidence in the deep seated belief that I *would* finish the marathon no matter what… So I had to make the goal more challenging.

When something is *seemingly* easy, I’m prone to slack off, so I set a goal of finishing the marathon in under 4 hours.

It was a pseudo-goal to help me reach my true goal of finishing the marathon.

I missed the 4 hour mark by 1 minute and 46 seconds but in the end I still achieved my real goal!

>***“A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.”***  
>  
>\-Bruce Lee

**9. Prepare ahead of time and prepare for the worst.**

In preparing for my marathon, I signed up for a half marathon and didn’t realize the trains wouldn't be running that early in the morning until the day of the half marathon.

I just assumed they'd be running because it was a big event. Well, I guess I made an ass out of myself…

I had to Tokyo Drift all the way to the city in my car from the train station, find parking, and sign in when everyone had already left the starting line.

In hindsight, I should have prepared and double-checked on the logistics of getting to the event much, much earlier - not just the night before.

***On top of this mishap…***

On the day of the marathon, the GPS on my phone wouldn’t connect and I had no way to track how fast I was running or how many miles I had run.

I did not expect this would be a problem at all but in hindsight I should have prepared for a ‘worst’ case scenario.

**10. Life is all about the process and the journey.**

Not the destination.

Throughout much of my training I kept questioning myself as to why I was doing all of this running for a ‘stupid’ marathon and all because I had made a ‘stupid’ commitment.

As a result, my training sessions leading up to the marathon were much more dreadful than they needed to be.

I could have had ***a lot more*** fun and enjoyed myself a lot more throughout the whole process if I had chosen instead to focus on the *right* things.

**11. The Rain is AWESOME.**

Most of us have been brainwashed into thinking that cold, rainy, and stormy weather is ‘bad’ weather but in reality, *that’s just, like, your opinion, man*.

Running in what some would consider the worst weather conditions to run in is something I'll never forget, I got a ton of joy and bliss out of those stormy runs.

**12. Being badass is subjective.**

I woke up and run at 5AM on weekdays to fit in my runs before heading off for work. Doing this made me feel like an absolute bad ass - *especially in the middle of winter*.

With everything else I managed to do in the mornings before work, I’d say I accomplished more than what most people did in a whole day, and all before they even got out of bed.

I was cruising in 6th gear when they hadn’t even fired up their engines.

**That to me was pretty bad ass.**

To others, that might seem like hell.

n65ttc,"Don’t tell anyone you’re starting shit. You get a fake rush of endorphins, you get the reward of acknowledgement that what you’re stating you’re gonna do is “so great” and “good for you!”  It’s fake ass praise and then you feel shame when you don’t follow through. Keep that shit close to your chest. Celebrate your success privately. Allow yourself to cherish small daily wins and the success or change you experience will show soon enough. At the end of the day we’re getting better for ourselves or those we love, and the expression that we’re changing or starting something without doing it is ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT to ourselves and those we love if we don’t follow through. If you privately fail, then privately pick your shit up, and keep chugging along. Never stop starting over. Each day is a battle.

Edit: SOMETIMES telling a select few can help. Sometimes external motivators in the forms of other people are nice. Still risky in my book. Imagine this: you read a bunch of books, start a side hustle and lose 20 pounds without telling anyone. If it seems less significant than doing the same with public knowledge, your motivations are likely off. Do it for yourself and those you love.

1kjwdte,"You're probably thinking this was the result of insane willpower, but I actually found it just as difficult as quitting any one of those things in isolation.

I'm going to split this into three parts: the effects I felt, my recommendations/ tips for anyone else trying it, and the context. The context is last because it's probably the least interesting but it's there to explain how long I had been trying to quit each vice for - it ranges from 1 year to 10 years.

Disclaimers: 
a) I used to read posts like this on the sub and think it was an exaggeration. But I genuinely feel this way - my mind was just so undisciplined that I had no idea what this could feel like.

b) I'm not here to say any one of these ""vices"" is bad. I just identified that I had an all or nothing mindset towards them, and I didn't like the impact it had on my life. 

1 | The effects

I feel unbelievably energetic, mentally clear, confident, witty, kind, and full of love for other people. I want to share the energy I now feel with friends and family and it feels amazing to make them happy. Going out of my way to plan things or get thoughtful gifts for people, offering to help people move houses with no payment. I have shed a thick layer of selfishness I had most of my life. Everybody is saying that something in me has changed hugely. 

I can plan better, I can tolerate boredom way better. Instead of reaching for my phone, I get a tea, go for a walk, tend to my plants, read a book. Books are suddenly insanely interesting. I can't put them down, just like when I was a kid. My hobbies are a million times more interesting. 

I get much more done at work, and I really care about my work. I can sit and focus literally all day at work because it's super interesting again. I can sit and do my hobbies like tech projects or language learning until I get hungry, thirsty, or my brain aches. 

This next part is a little bit self-indulgent, but anyway... I've been on successful dates with much more confident, smart, attractive people, because that's who I feel reflected in myself now. I feel very different on these dates - previously the brain fog or anxiety from my lifestyle would have prevented me from having lucid, flowing conversations for so long. But I can talk endlessly now and I think they can see that I genuinely like myself as well - which I didn't always feel before. 

I have a better bulwark against the things I was addicted to. Breaking multiple addictions at the same time has meant that any time I need to use more willpower to resist one of them, the lack of presence of the others makes it easier to resist. 

Finally, all those vices are just boring to me now. Scrolling is so uninteresting compared to a good novel or diving deep in a project. 

----------

2 | Recommendations

Quitting everything at once means you don't need to play whack a mole with your multiple vices when you quit one. I found I could quit something for a bit, but then noticed I'd replaced scrolling with sugar, then manage sugar and go to something else. 

My mindset was easily the biggest enemy before this. You need to be really, really kind and patient with yourself while you try to rewire your brain. Believe you can do it, even when your brain makes logical arguments you can't. I'm not religious but it is a form of faith - faith in yourself despite your track record. 

What also worked for me personally was the mentality that I only need to make it through today. I read something that said quitting any of these things for the rest of your life feels impossible - but making it til tonight? Easy. Besides that, I also gameified my progress using an LLM. This worked for as training wheels and now I don't need it. The former bit of advice is a constant mantra, however. 

But really, I don't think it's this specific advice that did it. I think that every person out there has one or more bits of advice that are gonna work for them personally. You need to try as much as you can to see what works for you. 

----------

3 | Context

For context, this is where I stood on everything before attempting it.

Reddit/ YouTube/ instagram, ie ""scrolling"": many attempts over the last say 6 years to cut down, some successful for about a month, but often replacing one with another. At its worst, I would be on YouTube in the shower and while brushing teeth. 

Added sugar: I've replaced this a bit with varied fruit. Attempted over the last 2 years, successful for about a month. 

Processed food: attempted for about 1 year after it became my replacement to quitting added sugar. 

Nsfw content: attempted for about 10 years. As mentioned at the start, I'm not here to recommend quitting if it's not an issue for you. But it was definitely the biggest issue for me.

Alcohol: I can resist alcohol pretty easily, and leading up to this I'd spent many months sober at a time. But when I did drink, I could easily drink way too much (if others were also binge drinking). I was halfway to sobriety, so I just decided to fully quit. This one was the easiest, but the health impacts of quitting even the occasional session has been great.

lw0bsm,"Starting in my mid-20s, my life completely transformed. In just a few years' time.

**I am writing this post to share the lessons I've learned. Including practical tips on how to change your life in your 20s.**

I'll be dividing things into 3 sections:

1. My story of transformation (in brief)
2. What NOT to do if you want to improve your life (things to avoid)
3. What to DO to change your life

**If you prefer video format, check out the first post in my profile.**

## Section 1: My Story (In Brief)

**My life dramatically changed from my mid to late 20s. In my mid-20s I:**

* Was socially awkward
* Rarely exercised
* Ate unhealthy foods
* Had no idea what I wanted to do in my career
* Played games and binge-watched shows all-day
* And had never been in a long-term relationship

**By my late 20s, I:**

* Was much more confident in social situations
* Exercised regularly
* Ate healthier
* Enjoyed my career
* Only played games or watched shows occasionally
* And by the time I turned 30, I was married to an amazing woman

**And you know what’s really awesome: 90% of my transformation took place in just a year or so!**

Once I applied the tips I am about to mention, change happened fairly quickly.

## Section 2: How to Change Your Life in Your 20s – What NOT to Do

Here are 5 tips for what to avoid doing, if you want your 20s to go in a positive direction.

## Tip Number 1: Don’t Hold on to Your Old Identity

In order to truly change, you need to let go of your Past Self.

**Do you have to let go of everything? Of course not. But you do want to shed the notion that you ARE fundamentally a certain way.**

For example:

* I am an awkward person.
* I am an undisciplined person.
* Or I am an out-of-shape person.

**Once you let go of your old identity, it is going to be easier to start forming new identities.**

Such as:

* I am a confident person.
* I am a disciplined person.
* Or I am a healthy person.

**Of course, you are going to have to couple this mindset shift with making actions that match. Which several of my other tips will touch on.**

But letting go of the past is an essential starting point.

## Tip Number 2: Don’t Compare Your Life to Other People’s Lives

When I was in my early to mid-20s, there was one thing I could always count on making me feel bad:

**Comparing where I was in life to where other people at a similar life stage were.**

Thoughts would enter my head like:

* **Why haven’t I found as much happiness in relationships?** A lot of people I know have had successful relationships by now.
* **I still have no idea what I want to do with my career.** But I just read about a billionaire CEO who is only 25 years old. And now I feel worse about myself.
* **How come some people I know are so confident in social situations, yet I am more awkward?** I wish my social skills were as good as theirs.

And you know where these kinds of thoughts got me? Absolutely nowhere.

**Once I finally stopped comparing myself to others, it became easier to focus on the things I could control.**

That is, the decisions I could make with my own life.

## Tip Number 3: Don’t Engage in Behaviors That Are Preventing You From Changing Your Life

**For a long time, I wanted desperately to change, but my bad habits kept getting in the way.**

Things like:

* Playing excessive amounts of video games.
* Binge-watching shows and podcasts.
* And eating too much junk food.

**Depending on what your bad habits are, it might be tough to change them.**

But know that you need to work towards removing or limiting those behaviors, in order to truly change your ways.

## Tip Number 4: Avoid People Who Are Holding You Back

Do you have friends or other people in your life who are making it harder to change?

Such as:

* **Bad Influencers:** People who tempt you to engage in behaviors you are trying to cut back on.
* **Change Resisters:** People who don’t like the idea of change and get upset when they see you changing.
* **Or Complainers:** People who are constantly complaining about where they are at in life. And whose way of thinking rubs off on you. Which causes you to complain more too.

If you have any people like this in your life, you have to either:

* **(A)** Distance them from your life. If that’s an option.
* **Or (B)** Establish clear boundaries with them, so they don’t prevent you from growing.

## Tip Number 5: When Trying to Change Your Life in Your 20s, Don’t Be Too Hard on Yourself

**On your journey to improve your life, things are going to happen.**

You are going to:

* Make mistakes.
* Miss opportunities.
* And fail to do all the things you know you should be doing.

And that’s okay. It’s perfectly natural and it’s going to happen.

**Remember, you aren’t going for perfection. You are just going for improvement.**

And that’s much more attainable.

## Section 3: How to Change Your Life in Your 20s – What to DO

Now that I’ve covered what NOT to do, it’s time to shift to what you should do.

Here are 9 tips for how to change your life in your 20s, that helped me turn things around.

## Tip Number 1: Change Your Life 1 Small Step at a Time

Change rarely comes from giant leaps. Instead, it comes through small decisions made day-after-day.

**I used to have an all-or-nothing mentality. And that resulted in me getting stuck in a vicious cycle:**

* First, I would work extremely hard towards changing my life for a few days or weeks.
* Then, I would burn out and not do anything for a long period.
* After doing nothing for a while, I would feel the need to make a change again. And would repeat the cycle.

**I finally got out of that cycle when I started focusing on making small changes.**

Changes that were small enough that I could keep up with them in the long-term.

Here’s how to do that:

* **Prioritize your goals:** You can’t do it all at once. Often it helps to just focus on 1 new change at a time.
* **When starting a new habit, go as tiny as possible:** For example, if you want to start meditating, don’t try to do 30 minutes a day. Instead, start with something smaller. Like 1 minute. Wait until you’ve formed a strong habit before you start making things more challenging.
* **Have specific, tangible goals:** You are much more likely to follow through with a small, specific goal, than a broad, vague plan. For example, you are not that likely to commit to something general, like “I want to learn programming.” But you are much more likely to commit to something specific, like “I am going to watch this introduction to JavaScript tutorial tomorrow morning.”

**If you start small, it will ADD UP to great things.**

## Tip Number 2: Get Organized!

If you want to change, one of the first places to start is organizing your life.

**Organization makes it easier for you to follow through with your goals. Because the more structured your life is, the more control you have over it.**

Here are some ways to get more organized:

* **Keep a to-do list:** When you write down your plans, you are much more likely to follow through with them.
* **Have a regular schedule:** Wake up and go to bed at similar times each day. And consider having regular morning and night routines you follow.
* **Clean your place:** It doesn’t have to be completely pristine, but it helps to establish good cleaning habits. A cleaner environment can put you in a better mindset to accomplish things.

## Tip Number 3: Take Care of Your Body

**One of the most helpful ways to change your life in your 20s is to prioritize your physical health.**

That means:

* Exercise
* Eat healthier
* Maintain good personal hygiene
* Get sufficient sleep
* And drink enough water

**Once I started exercising and eating healthier, everything else in my life started to fall into place.**

## Tip Number 4: Spend Time on Internal Growth

**In addition to taking care of your physical health, it is also important to focus on your mental health and emotional well-being.**

Here are a few things that can help:

* Meditation
* Journaling
* Informally reflecting on your life and ways of thinking
* And of course, therapy

## Tip Number 5: Improve Your Social Skills

**I used to be incredibly awkward in social situations.**

My awkwardness was particularly severe during high school and in college. But continued to an extent through my mid-20s.

**It wasn’t until I started consciously working on developing my social abilities, that my awkwardness started to diminish.**

Here are some keys to improving your social skills:

* **Go outside of your comfort zone:** In my mid-20s, I made a conscious effort to try to be more social than I had been and to meet new people. And as a result, I made some great connections.
* **Open Up:** I used to be more closed off. Unless I was around my close friends, I tended to shut down. For a long time, that held me back, because people are attracted to genuineness. Once I started opening up more, it helped me develop closer relationships.
* **Listen:** I used to be a horrible listener. Becoming a better listener has led to much deeper and better conversations, both personally and professionally. And has also helped me understand people better.

## Tip Number 6: Change Your Life in Your 20s by Helping Others

**Being there for other people can help you find a sense of meaning in your own life.**

Here are some ways to do that:

* Volunteer
* Be kind to random people you meet
* Or help people close to you

**For me, a big part of my sense of purpose is helping my wife through her struggles with mental illness.**

Being there to support her and help her through tough times has given me a reason to get up every morning.

## Tip Number 7: Try New Things (Even If You Aren’t 100% Sure About Them)

One thing that demoralized me a lot in my 20s, was the pressure I felt to know what I wanted to do in life.

**But here’s the secret: You don’t need to have all the answers. Sometimes, you just have to give things a shot. And see what works.**

Adopting this mindset led me to many new and rewarding experiences.

For instance, I:

* **Started going after different jobs:** Even if I didn’t know what I wanted to do in my career.
* **Experimented with exercise programs:** Even if I wasn’t sure if they had the “perfect routine.”
* **And had conversations with new people:** Even if I didn’t know if they would result in longer term connections.

Trying new things doesn’t always work out. But if you keep experimenting, you might discover some pretty incredible opportunities.

## Tip Number 8: Form Habits Instead of Relying on Motivation

Everything else I’ve mentioned is only going to work if you establish habits.

**Habits are behaviors that are so ingrained into your routine that you do them without having to be:**

* Motivated
* Energized
* Or inspired

You can incorporate habits into nearly any area of your life. For example:

* **If you want to improve your social skills,** you could start by forming a habit of initiating a conversation with a stranger once a week.
* **If you want to get a job,** you could start a habit of sending in 1 application every Monday.
* **Or if you want to clean a messy room in your apartment,** you could make a habit of doing 5 minutes of cleaning once a week. I am actually currently in the process of this one.

Habits are incredibly powerful and are capable of completely changing your life.

## Tip Number 9: Love and Accept Yourself

If you want to improve your life in your 20s, a great thing to focus on is learning to accept and love yourself.

**Yes, you want to improve. But that doesn’t mean you can’t love yourself until you’ve made it to the finish line. A finish line that may not even exist.**

I’m not saying loving yourself is going to be easy. Depending on where you are at, it may take time.

**But if you can begin to accept yourself, it will make the rest of your journey more enjoyable.**

## Final Words

Sometimes it's important to remember that it's not a crime to end up doing something later than you intended on that day. You don't have to guilt trip yourself into following an absolutely rigid schedule where failure to adhere to the schedule means you feel like you have to wait until the next day before you try again.

I’d spend hours watching people live their lives while mine passed me by. I knew what I should do, but I never did  it. And the worst part? No one was stopping me but me.

I used to think I needed motivation. Or some crazy routine. Or the perfect conditions. But what I really needed was honesty. Brutal honesty. To stop lying to myself. To stop blaming my past, my family, my situation, my genes. So today I got tired. Not tired like sleepy. Tired of my own bullshit. So I did something small. I got out of bed without snoozing. I drank water instead of grabbing my phone. I wrote down 3 things I wanted to do  and I did them. 

No dopamine rush. No claps. No applause. Just quiet progress. And for once, that was enough.

If you're reading this, stop waiting for a perfect version of yourself to arrive. You become that person by doing the boring, hard, unsexy stuff every day, especially when you don’t feel like it. Here’s what’s been helping me:

* Set 3 daily non-negotiables. Small ones. Like drink 1L of water, 20-minute walk, 10-minute journal. Hit them no matter what.
* Limit phone use in the morning. Your brain deserves peace, not chaos.
* When you slip (and you will), don’t throw away the day. Salvage what you can. 50% effort is still better than 0%.
* Stop chasing motivation. Build discipline through action.

Shower. Not a bath, a shower. Use water as hot or cold as you like. You don’t even need to wash. Just get in under the water and let it run over you for a while. Sit on the floor if you gotta.

Moisturize everything. Use whatever lotion you like. Unscented? Dollar store lotion? Fancy 48 hour lotion that makes you smell like a field of wildflowers? Use whatever you want, and use it all over your entire dermis. 

Put on clean, comfortable clothes. 

Put on your favorite underwear. Cute black lacy panties? Those ridiculous boxers you bought last christmas with candy cane hearts on the butt? Put them on.

Drink cold water. Use ice. If you want, add some mint or lemon for an extra boost. I always use lemon. 

Clean something. Doesn’t have to be anything big. Organize one drawer of a desk. Wash five dirty dishes. Do a load of laundry. Scrub the bathroom sink. 

Blast music. Listen to something upbeat and dancey and loud, something that’s got lots of energy. Sing to it, dance to it, even if you suck at both.

Make food. Don’t just grab a granola bar to munch. Take the time and make food. Even if it’s ramen. Add something special to it, like a soft boiled egg or some veggies. Prepare food, it tastes way better, and you’ll feel like you accomplished something. 

Make something. Write a short story or a poem, draw a picture, color a picture, fold origami, crochet or knit, sculpt something out of clay, anything artistic. Even if you don’t think you’re good at it. Create. 

Go outside. Take a walk. Sit in the grass. Look at the clouds. Smell flowers. Put your hands in the dirt and feel the soil against your skin.

Call someone. Call a loved one, a friend, a family member, call a chat service if you have no one else to call. Talk to a stranger on the street. Have a conversation and listen to someone’s voice. If you can’t bring yourself to call, text or email or whatever, just have some social interaction with another person. Even if you don’t say much, listen to them. It helps. 

Cuddle your pets if you have them/can cuddle them. Take pictures of them. Talk to them. Tell them how you feel, about your favorite movie, a new game coming out, anything.

z9q8hm,"# Part 1: The Problem

You’re stuck in a rut.

Apathy. Lethargy. Whole days wasted away on Reddit or YouTube. Procrastinating on basically everything. Coasting by in a mediocre existence.

You don’t want to keep living like this. You want to break out—to work hard and change your lifestyle, get fit, get a better job, start a business, pursue a creative dream—but for whatever reason, it's just impossible. You can never find the motivation to stick with anything.

You decide to dig; see if you can uncover *something* that will unlock your motivation. You find a motivational video that describes it perfectly.

>*You're drifting without clear purpose or aim. So you need establish your WHYs behind the many WHATs of your dreams.*

So you do all that.

And for the first time in a while, you feel a flicker of hope. You feel a little determination, a little eagerness to get to work.

So you sit down to make it happen—but then it hits you. That dreaded *ugh I just don't feel like it* feeling. You try to willpower through it, but not 5 minutes later, you're back on Reddit.

What gives?

….

Here’s the deal.

You're confusing inspiration with motivation. You're assuming they're essentially the same when, really, they're not.

The word motivation comes from the Latin word for “to move”. Interpret this, not as *the will to move*—that’s the domain of inspiration—but as *the capacity to move.*

All that “why” stuff is important, but it’s the stuff of inspiration. It’s the conscious will and intention to get your work done and achieve your goals. But you have plenty if that.

More is just not the solution.

**Motivation, on the other hand, is the subconscious** ***approval*** **to burn calories to do work.**

To use a car analogy, inspiration has you push on the gas pedal—and perhaps you’ll jam on it down extra hard if you have David Goggins blaring at you—but motivation… that’s the fuel injector.

That's the part way deep in the engine that you have no direct control over. It's the valve that ""decides"" to release fuel for combustion, which is what actually propels the heavy chunk of metal forwards.

Not saying it’s not important to get clear on your “whys”—a car won’t go fast or far if the pedal is barely tapped. I’m saying… your injector's been disabled. So you need to fix that first.

Here's a 5-step process to get there.

# Part 2: The Solution

# Step 1. First prevent what suppresses motivation

Us humans have serious survival needs. There's food, water, shelter... yet our psychological needs—love, intimacy, status, connection, adventure/novelty—are just as important.

Back in the day, the cost to satisfy those needs were egregiously high. It took boat loads of effort, time and risk to survive. We therefore evolved a motivation → reward neurological pathway, a system to subconsciously *compel* us to burn precious calories—yet with only the exact minimum amount required—in the pursuit of survival affirming rewards.

For the pleasure of food, you had to hunt.

For the pleasure of intimacy and sex, you had to court and risk being ostracized.

For the pleasure of status, you had to acquire resources.

There was always a tight balance between the reward and its energy and risk demand.

But that’s all changed.

With today’s vices, we can trick our brains into *perceiving* that these base needs are satisfied with virtually no work or risk.

For the pleasure of food, there's Door Dash.

For  the pleasure of intimacy and sex, there’s porn.

For the pleasure of status, there’s social media.

Today’s giant food, tech and entertainment industries have left no stone unturned. **Every single one of our base needs has its vice equivalent—a consumable product that can deliver psychological rewards via artificial or vicarious means.**

All that to say the “motivation” part of the motivation → reward pathway is no longer needed. Your subconscious—your body's fuel injector that *decides* whether or not to burn precious calories for survival—is now programmed to know it can ""survive"" exceptionally well with the flick of a thumb.

That’s why, after spending your morning on Reddit… then Pornhub, then Instagram, then YouTube… just the thought of opening up a work spreadsheet feels so grueling and unappealing.

It doesn't matter how adamantly your conscious mind is demanding the burning of calories. Doesn't matter if it's clamoring about the importance of long-term goals or about impending doom.

Your subconscious is utterly convinced that everything's fine—*c'mon man, just look at all the survival-affirming rewards we just felt!*—and that under no circumstances should scarce energy be burned.

The take-away is this: consuming vices does more than just waste time. They suppress motivation. They lead to resistance; to that drained, *ugh I just don’t feel like it* feeling.

Consume less crap. Practice digital minimalism. Delete and block stimulating sites and apps.

And when you need to, relax and unwind with less stimulating activities: reading, writing, creating, socializing, self-care.

# Step 2. Arrive at the proper mindset

I like to say that motivation is a cat.

It won’t come to you if you’re desperate for it; if you *need* it to come. You have to sit still for a short while, “pretend” like you don’t actually need it, only then will saunter over to you.

In other words, you need to find acceptance. You need to find acceptance of all that is now, in this tiny sliver of the present moment.

**Understand: The motivation to change things only happens once you come to accept the way things are.**

It's a colossal paradox.

But it makes perfect sense once you realize that the most productive people out there aren't motivated because they hate their lives and and are yearning for change. They aren't riddled with unsatisfied needs and wants. They already feel whole and complete as they are; yet they also have a fire lit under them to work, hustle and make themselves and the world better.

But coming to acceptance isn’t particularly fast or easy. If you go through with the first step above, you’re going to be left with a vacuum of your attention that will quickly fill with the thoughts, feelings and emotions—worry, anxiety, regret, stress, boredom—you’ve been impulsively using vices to distract and relieve.

So it’s going to feel like ""the now"" is anything but ok. It's going to feel like your life, as it is now, is just not good enough to accept as is.

Anticipate this.

There is no antidote. No prevention. The only way out is through. You’ll just have to sit tight for a while and be *mindful* of the experience.

Mindfulness is the practice of disassociating yourself from these thoughts, feelings and emotions. It involves observing dispassionately, them as if they were occurring outside you.

>*hmm, there it is, that feeling again. That dark cloud of depression and hopelessness. I feel it right there in my gut. It's not pleasant, but I’ll just sit and watch until it passes.*

From there, from that detached state, it'll be possible to come to a  gentle acceptance of all that is.

\*If you're finding this step particularly difficult or taxing, the support and guidance of a therapist can be key.

# Step 3. Start small with tiny amounts of willpower

You’re heard of the concept of tiny or atomic habits. It’s where you strip down and simplify a habit you want to take on until it becomes *almost* trivial to accomplish—one squat per day, when you want to be doing 50; one sentence written per day, when you want to be writing a 3 pages.

Starting small with habits is essential.

The trick is to just show up for the habit, without forcing yourself to start right away. Sit and wait. See if a drip of motivation occurs to you. If it doesn’t, see if you can use a little willpower to nudge you forward. If it’s really not happening—if you don’t have the spoons—just let go and come back tomorrow.

The beautiful thing is that actions *cause* more actions. It self perpetuates. Get started small and see your motivation to do a little more each time grow.

# Step 4. Engage in self-care and lifestyle actions

Motivation—in the free flowing amounts you want—ain’t free. It needs to be earned.

This happens by taking care.

First take care of yourself. Get good sleep. Cook and eat well. Practice good hygiene. Learn, create, explore. Take the time for recreation, relaxation, play.

Next, take care of others. Nothing nourishes the human spirit like doing good for others. It could be for your immediate circle, but also for your community, people of the internet, or the planet. Whatever floats your boat.

Positive action leads to positive feelings leads to the desire to take more positive action. The more you do good, the more you *want* to do good.

# Throughout. Be patient and self-compassionate

Self-compassion and patience is key in all this.

The state of your subconscious has nothing to do with who you are as a person. You wouldn’t look at a Ferrari with a disconnected fuel injector and conclude it’s a terribly, slow car.

So be ready to accept the fact that flossing even a single tooth might feel like an endeavor. Self-contempt and criticism in this are neither helpful nor deserved.

All this takes time. Motivation is cultivated just like a plant (last metaphor, I promise).

You need to gently place the seed in the right soil, give it a spec of nutrients and a splash of water—see the three steps above—but then it needs time to germinate, extend roots (which you won’t see for a while) and finally grow into a fruit bearing plant.

You can’t force it. You can’t make it grow faster. Too much sun and it burns, too much water and it drowns.

Let it be. Allow time to pass. Take the time to mindfully explore your emotions and inner sensations and detach from them.

Be compassionate with yourself when (and not if) you slip up. Remember: your subconscious is still programmed to believe it can survive best through vices. It'll take time, a bit of effort, and some good defenses (webblockers, environmental changes) to override and then rewire this programming.

And that does you little good.

# Past-focused mindset

""If I had only started playing guitar 2 years ago when my friend did, I would have been so good by now.""

""If I had only stuck to my diet 6 months back I'd be in such great shape today.""

""If I had only spent the last year being productive instead of spending most of my time distracting myself with games/TV, I would be so much more successful.""

# Future-focused mindset

**What if instead, you re-framed your thinking, from feeling regret and guilt about the past, to imagining the possibilities of the future?**

""Just imagine how great I could get at guitar if I play consistently for the next 2 years?""

""Just imagine how great shape I can be in if I eat healthy for the next 6 months?

""Just imagine how successful I will become if I spend the next year being more productive and spending less time distracting myself?

# Present-focused mindset

**What if in addition to re-framing your mindset from past to future-focused, you also focused more on what actionable steps you can take in the present?**

""What specific steps can I take today to improve my guitar skills?""

""What is a healthy meal I can have for dinner tonight to get on the path towards getting in better shape?""

""What is 1 thing I can do today that is productive?""

# Summing it up

I think both the future-focused and present-focused mindsets are helpful.

**Future-focused thinking** is helpful for determining your long-term goals/priorities, as well as for inspiration.

The **present-focused mindset** is helpful for forming more specific plans, and achieving moment-to-moment satisfaction.

**Past-focused thinking** has it's place too (e.g., assessing past performance can help inform future changes in your strategy).  But when you are focusing too much on the past in a negative way (regret, guilt, shame at what you did), that is less helpful.

kf9t7n,"I realized this after spending 3 months of such poor discipline that I was going to bed in the mornings and waking up at night. Gaming and binge watching YouTube, obsessing over social media. Eating only when I was hungry. Not taking care of my hygiene because I was always so unmotivated and tired. And just generally feeling like crap, _every.single.day._

It got to the point where nothing was enjoyable and I didn't enjoy anything I did no matter how 'exciting' the game or movie etc should've/would've been if I wasn't like this. Even simple things like looking forward to a nice delicious meal or a warm shower or a freshly made bed was irrelevant to my meaningless existence. I was living just to simply 'exist' and nothing more.

But, then I realized that to make my existence more meaningful. Say like how it felt when I was a kid, (everyone here remembers those times I'm sure. Those exhilarating moments of pure bliss and joy and laughter and happiness and living life because it was a joy to experience it. The bright outdoors, the warm sun, the singing birds, the beautiful colors of nature, the happiness of others i.e. At the beach or theme park etc.) That to experience that kind of 'joy' again, to make my life more meaningful like that again. Requires facing the risk of getting sunburnt, or falling over and skinning your knee, or getting picked on by other kids, or getting told off by your parents etc (all in context from the perspective of a child).

 And those are all significant risks and/or potentially painful experiences, but they don't take away from a child's enjoyment because the child doesn't think about those risks. It's the worrying parent that does. The parent who is fearing their child might hurt themselves, or that their child might get hurt, feel hurt, be hurt by others, i.e. other kids. And sometimes these worries that the worrying parent has for their children affects their child's enjoyment. It limits their freedom, it limits their experiences, it limits the amount of fun they can have.

So to piece it together. I'm limiting the amount of 'joy' I can experience by worrying about things I shouldn't be worried about. This 'avoidance' is like not going out for a run because you're afraid you might twist your ankle. Yet by staying at home and sitting around or sleeping. You risk many other health problems and issues far worse than a sprained ankle. And that's not all. The sprained ankle is only a 'potential risk' with a very low probability of it actually happening. The health issues that come from no exercise vary in significance greatly and there is a far greater chance of lasting adverse effects from lack of exercise than a sprained ankle. 

On top of that, emotionally speaking, it feels great to be able to rest your weary legs and tired feet after a nice long run. Whereas sitting down all day does not feel great. You don't find any pleasure in 'resting' after having not done anything. To sum it up. Pain and suffering is inevitable. But it's the choice that's yours. Do you want it now and consequently live out a happier, healthier life because you faced it. Or do you want it later and life a miserable and meaningless life, full of regret and sorrow. Because you're going to experience pain and suffering one way or another. It's the choice of facing and dealing with it head-on, or saving it for later. The choice is yours.",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] If you try and live your life avoiding pain and suffering by not 'doing things' that you know would be beneficial to you.

For years, I dealt with constant fatigue and a complete lack of drive to do anything beyond the absolute essentials.

Back when I was in school, I managed to graduate, but never reached the academic potential I knew I had. Later, at work, I could hold down a job, but I never really thrived. I always had intentions to eat better, exercise, and take care of myself, but despite the goals I set, I could never stick to anything long enough to see results. Over time, my health declined, and the cycle just kept repeating.

I tried to boost my productivity with systems like David Allen’s GTD and countless optimization techniques, but none of it stuck, I simply couldn’t follow through.

Eventually, I came across an episode of Huberman’s podcast where he talked about dopamine regulation. That episode changed everything. I had always assumed that my lack of motivation was due to ADHD or something similar, but for the first time, I realized it might actually be tied to how I was engaging with habits and dopamine, something I could work on and influence.

One thing became immediately obvious: like so many others, I was completely hooked on my phone. My day started and ended with scrolling. After listening to that podcast, I saw clearly how overstimulated I had become.

Breaking that addiction became a full-on mission for me. It wasn’t easy, but I eventually cut my screen time from over 7 hours a day to under an hour.

And honestly? That single change transformed my life.

I started sleeping better. My energy lasted through the day. I now work out consistently because I actually enjoy it. I began cooking for myself and eating healthy. I even left my job to start my own business.

Looking back, it was hands-down the most impactful decision I ever made.

I genuinely believe this is something almost everyone is grappling with today. Whenever someone tells me they’re struggling with focus, discipline, or just improving their life, the first thing I suggest is tackling phone addiction. It’s the keystone habit that makes room for all the other good habits.

Cutting back on screen time is hard, but here are a few things that helped me make a real difference:

Delay phone use in the morning. Try waiting at least an hour after waking up before you touch your phone. Your dopamine levels reset while you sleep, so mornings are when your self-control is strongest. Take advantage of that window.


Use a screen time tracker that works for you. App blockers didn’t do much for me. What helped was switching to an app, that makes reducing screen time a kind of game, rewarding you with dopamine for staying off your phone. You can even play with friends. But there are other good ones out there too,  the key is finding one that keeps you engaged.


Remove your most distracting apps from your phone. You don’t need to delete your accounts, just remove the apps so you can only access them from a computer. When you do that, you’re forced to use them more intentionally instead of scrolling mindlessly.

You’re not just going to wake up as a productive supersoldier.

You have to start implementing seemingly small changes today, and building on them every day or every week. 

Our bodies and minds don’t like dramatic change of any kind, so you need to take small steps in the right direction.

Get up 15 minutes earlier than usual, not 3 hours.

Have warm showers then turn them cold for the last quarter, so you don’t just end up avoiding showers or having extremely short ones because that’s just unhygienic. 

Try to workout one day per week more than you’re currently doing, not daily. 

Start surfing the internet a little less than usual instead of blocking all your favourite diversion sites.

Add some steamed vegetables to your dinner, drink a bit more water than usual - don’t just throw out your entire fridge and restock it with organic food. 

Read a few pages of a book instead of expecting to get through an entire chapter.

Have one difficult conversation you’ve been putting off and go from there - don’t just flip your persona overnight. 

Make eye contact and some conversation with someone you’re attracted to where it’s appropriate- don’t try to get rejected 10 times per day so you’re immune to it or whatever that literature suggests. 

Drop masturbation back to once or twice per week (or thereabouts) instead of doing some total abstinence, although only do it when you’re in the mood not procrasturbating. 

Acknowledge any progress no matter how small. Accept failures no matter how large. 

Expecting to flip your lifestyle upside down overnight because you just read “you can’t hurt me” or listened to a jocko willink podcast might work for a few hours, maybe even a few days, but the change will eventually seem too drastic and you’ll rebound back to your old habits.

This may seem slack and counterintuitive but it’s essentially learning how to self reward to create sustainable change. Recent Neuroscientific research also corroborates that this ability is instrumental in allowing an individual to achieve formidable long term goals. 

For too many years I believed that my ultra disciplined alter ego was right around the corner - so today was one last rodeo of dissolution before I pulled myself up by the bootstraps and got disciplined. 

Only later did I truly realise this was an excuse to avoid taking any action. 

So start now.

**Why Cold showers are amazing**

*  seriously, nothing wakes you up faster than freezing water. apparently, cold showers make your body release adrenaline, which is why you go from ""zombie mode"" to ""ready to fight a bear in like 10 seconds.

>*A study in Medical Hypotheses says cold showers release norepinephrine, which is this brain chemical that makes you more alert and less blah.*

* after a cold shower, my brain feels calm. It's not like magic or anything, but a study from 2007 says cold water can lower your stress hormone (cortisol). I feel it.
*  I don't know how it works, but doing something so uncomfortable first thing in the morning makes the rest of my day feel easier.
* if you can stand in the freezing water for 3 minutes, you can pretty much do anything.

  
**How to survive the freezing hell**

* trust me, don't jump strait into ice-cold water unless you wanna hate your life. start with 10-15 seconds at the end of a warm shower and slowly add more time every day.
* when the cold hits, your brain is gonna scream ""Get out!"" but just use this method called box breathing, (inhale for 4 secs, hold for 4, exhale for 4.) Trust me. It works.
* the more consistent you are, the less it sucks. i missed one day and felt like a slug again. don't miss a day.

  
**More research**

>*A 2008 study says cold showers make your brain release beta-endorphines, which are like feel-good chemicals that make you happy. it's like a natural antidepressant.*  


>*PLOS ONE did a study and found people who took cold showers got sick less often.*

>  
*Cold water also improves circulation and reduces inflammation, according to actual doctors. so yeah, it's good for your body too.*

  
**Read this part**

wake the fuck up and stop taking the easy way out. life isn't gonna hand you discipline on a silver platter, and cold showers are the ultimate test to prove you can handle discomfort. If you can't stand just 2 minutes of freezing water, how are you gonna handle real challenges? cold showers aren't just about waking up, they're about rewiring your brain to stop being weak and start doing hard stuff.

stop overthinking it, stop making excuses, and just do it. step into the freezing water, show yourself you're tougher than you think. two weeks of this, and you'll walk out feeling like a new person.

ijxtaa,"**TL;DR:** Switch to Robot Mode where you don't care about how well you perform in the task. Then work in a timeframe you feel comfortable with. Track and make your next day 1% better.

**Edit:**

People think that it's hard to switch to robot mode, or robot mode is not useful for tasks with high cognitive load tasks such as studying.  u/successufd has some good advice in his original [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ijaekv/needadvice_i_love_the_idea_of_planning_writing/g3d0svd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for how to switch into robot mode. It also seems like not everyone can get into a phase where they are unbothered by the outcome and their emotions. To me, robot mode is essentially a phase where you are doing the minimal shit within a timeframe because you have told yourself to, not because it helps your life better or etc. It's NOT a mode where you consciously envision your goal coming true, or where you think about the good things about the job. **Robot Mode is a mode where you say, ""I'm not going to do anything else other than this thing because I've instructed myself to do, and it's completely okay that I do a shitty job.""**

My take is that robot mode is very effective for tasks that are brain-demanding. Here's how I do things during the initial phase: for research, I spend half an hour typing nonsense; for researching graduate schools, I spend half an hour surfing a college website; for programming, I spend half a hour copying documentation. The most important thing are **iterations, which is why I include Tips 2 and 3.** You want many sessions improving a poorly done job, and getting from shitty to brilliant is usually faster than you thought.

**Edit 2:** As pointed out by u/Gwendilater, u/dangsoggyoatmeal, u/June8th that I might have ADHD, I did ASRS (self-report test for ADHD) and **guess what I found, I do have ADHD. My life has been a lie – I thought I was just normal for being impatient, careless, and forgetful.**

I procrastinate a lot, and by tracking my work hours, I realize that I've only worked on things that matter for 4.5 hours every day. For the rest of the time, I spend it on Youtube, Facebook, and Reddit.

Those negative emotions associated with a task drive a person to procrastinate. **I realize that the source of negative emotions is that we care about how well we perform in our task, and our ego doesn't want us to perform poorly.**

If we know that we can do well in a task and we can complete it within an acceptable time frame (like in 15 minutes), we would not hesitate to do it. But when we cannot see ourselves confidently tackling the task, or when we see ourselves unable to complete it fast enough (such as cleaning the dishes in 5 minutes), we tend to procrastinate. Our primal brain prefers not doing a task to doing a task poorly.

Here are the things that work for me:

1. **Switch to Machine Mode (Robot Mode)**: A machine only carries out instruction. It's more than ""Just do it."" - the instruction you give is ""Just do the task in XXX minutes (a time frame you are comfortable with; you cannot force yourself to overwork)."" A machine doesn't care about the feelings, the outcome, and the feedback for the task.
2. **Negotiate with yourself and understand that time-frame is non-linear**: A lot of people including me like to tyrannize ourselves by forcing ourselves to complete a task in an uncomfortable timeframe. And we call it self-discipline, and we feel bad when we cannot complete it in time. (Think about how you rush stuff right before the deadline.)  After a lot of journaling, I find that it's beneficial to understand planning fallacy: sometimes, it takes longer to complete the task; sometimes, it takes a shorter time (esp. if you are in the flow). So, find a time that you are comfortable with (maybe just 5 minutes) and switch to machine mode.
3. **Track your time and plan your next day such that it is 1% better than today**: Drastic changes don't work. You will fall back to bad habits. Here's a better alternative – first, track how you spend your time comfortably in a day, which is usually a combination of work (or errands) and play. Then, refer to this tracking when you schedule your next day - you don't want to deviate too much. For example, I work from 9am to 12pm, and I surf Facebook from 3pm to 6pm today. Tomorrow, I will work from 8:30am to 12pm, and I will surf Facebook from 4pm to 6pm.

1gx14g7,"# About me:

For over two decades, I lived a life completely lacking discipline. I was the textbook definition of a mess:

* I’d skip school for weeks or months at a time.
* I’d spend entire nights binge-watching garbage on the internet, ignoring responsibilities.
* My grades were abysmal, assignments were always overdue, and I had no focus or direction in life.
* Add to that an addiction to fast food and endless social media scrolling, and you get a clear picture of someone stuck in a downward spiral.

Fast forward to today, and I’m a completely different person.

* I’ve worked as a software engineer at Fortune 500 companies.
* My academic performance improved drastically.
* I consistently lift weights, read books, train in martial arts, and work on my business.

How did this transformation happen? It wasn’t overnight, and it wasn’t by simply “trying harder.”

Here’s what worked for me:

# 1. I Stopped Relying on Willpower

For years, I thought discipline was all about willpower. You just “decide” to do something, and then you do it—right? Wrong.

I learned that willpower is like a battery—it runs out. Sure, you can force yourself to wake up early, work out, or eat clean for a few days, but eventually, your reserves will deplete, and you’ll revert back to old habits.

Here’s an analogy that helped me understand this:

Imagine you’re thrown into a pit with 50 other people, all heavily armed with body armor, rifles, and night vision goggles. You, on the other hand, have nothing but a tiny knife. Your chances of surviving that fight are slim to none.

Relying solely on willpower is like being that person in the pit—it’s an uphill battle you’re almost destined to lose.

So, I stopped relying on raw willpower and started equipping myself with better tools.

# 2. I Built Systems

The most important shift I made was creating systems that removed the need for constant decision-making and made discipline automatic.

# System 1: A Routine

I started organizing my day into a routine. Every activity—working out, studying, eating, and even relaxing—had a specific time slot.

Why does this work?

1. **It removes decision fatigue:** Constantly debating whether to go to the gym, study, or scroll on your phone is mentally exhausting. With a routine, there’s no debate—you just follow the plan.
2. **It prepares your mind for what’s coming:** If you know you’re hitting the gym in 30 minutes, your brain starts to prepare for it. This makes transitioning into the activity much easier.

**Pro Tip:** Remove barriers to action. For example, if I know I need to study after dinner, I set out my books, clean my desk, and know exactly what I need to tackle beforehand. This eliminates excuses and makes starting much easier.

# System 2: A Rulebook

I also created a personal ""code of conduct""—rules I don’t break, no matter what. These are based on patterns I noticed in my life. For instance:

* **Rule: No phone for the first 4 hours of the day**. In the past, I’d start my day by checking notifications and scrolling through social media. It seemed harmless but would ruin my focus and fill my mind with chaotic energy. Now, I avoid my phone in the morning, and my days are far more productive and peaceful.

You can create your own rules based on your triggers. For example, if hanging out with a certain friend always leads to bad habits, consider limiting that interaction. Write down your rules, and stick to them like your life depends on it—because in some ways, it does.

# 3. I Switched from Instant to Delayed Gratification

In my undisciplined days, my life revolved around instant gratification:

* Hours of video games.
* Scrolling endlessly on Instagram.
* Eating fast food and snacking whenever I felt like it.

These activities gave me a quick dopamine hit, but they came at a cost. I felt unmotivated, unproductive, and unhappy. Worse, I craved more of these fleeting pleasures just to feel a baseline level of satisfaction, which created a vicious cycle.

The breakthrough came when I discovered the power of delayed gratification:

* The sense of accomplishment after a workout.
* The satisfaction of completing a productive work session.
* The happiness that comes from knowing I made progress toward my goals.

Unlike instant gratification, delayed gratification doesn’t leave you drained or craving more—it leaves you fulfilled. Over time, I found myself craving these long-lasting rewards instead of the quick dopamine hits.

# What I’ve Learned

Discipline isn’t about brute-forcing your way through life. It’s about creating an environment that supports your goals and adopting systems that make progress inevitable.

If you’re struggling with discipline, ask yourself:

* Are you relying too much on willpower?
* Do you have a routine or rules that guide your daily life?
* Are you chasing fleeting pleasures or long-term fulfillment?

rp90zx,"I just wanted to make this somewhat quick. I just turned 30 not too long ago, so I am a bit older than some of the people who frequent this subreddit. I'm at the stage of my life where I can see the effects of long-term discipline or long-term neglect on various life choices that I and others have made. From the outside, my life looks ""alright"". I never did any hardcore drugs or got into trouble, I work a respectable job making 70k/year remotely that I just got a couple of months ago, I have a decent body that is the result of many gym sessions over the years, I read a lot. But I know that I fell far short of my potential, especially when I had a lot of time stretching ahead of me. My conscience haunts me in the night hours and in the early mornings. There are times when I wake up in the middle of the night feeling massive pangs of anxiety.

We all think we have time when we just leave college and life and potential stretches out before us. ""Tomorrow"", we say. Tomorrow I'll go to the gym. Tomorrow I'll learn that programming language. Next year I'll start saving money. I'll ask that girl out when I'm ready. I'm going to move out when I save up enough. But tomorrow passes and nothing happens. No action is taken. No discipline is executed.

I spent the past 8 years mired in stagnation and mediocrity with various aspects of my lifestyle lagging. What are some of these areas? Let's take dating for example. I am a guy that has never had any success with women. I could have spent some time really getting this area of my life dialed in. I could have gone out on any random night and get rejected (or even a number). I had an entire year in 2018 when I was unemployed and could have done so. But I made excuses. Not enough money, I'm not jacked enough, not funny enough, I still live at home, blah, blah, blah. Now, I'm at an age where I'm behind in this area and it only gets harder. Why? Lack of self-discipline.

I still live at home at an age where I should have been moved out. I moved back in after college and never left. I spent years un/underemployed. I even started a business that exploded in my face. But if I look at it closely, I could have succeed in the business. I could have moved out sooner. But I didn't. Why? Lack of self-discipline.

All of my friends fled back to their home states or moved entirely after college. I have not had a solid social circle since 2013. I put off the hard work of being social and making friends because I said ""I'm going to be moving anyway, not much use in doing it"". That was in 2014. We're still at square one in that area. Why? Lack of self-discipline.

There's many areas we can hone in on. My fitness level is subpar compared to the time I spent on it, my finances are rock bottom, I have little travel experience...so many things. And I now have to give an account of the last 8 years since I left college. I had 8 (well, 7 if you're not counting when we went into lockdown last year) years to capitalize on. What happened in the last 8 years that no lifestyle progress was made? Why did you waste your 20s? Simple. One answer. Lack of self-discipline.

I was reading a quote by Jim Rohn that said something along the lines of ""we will suffer one of two pains in life: the pain of self-discipline or the pain of regret. The only thing is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons"".

I'm dedicating 2022 to extreme lifestyle mastery. The person I am now is not suitable to get me to the next stage. I look back on my life with extreme regret. Most of my friends are married or in a serious relationship and are moving into the next phase of their lives. I can't relate to many people my age. My most crucial period of life - my 20s - I squandered them in isolation, with a lack of drive, and a complete inability to truly challenge myself. I can never get those years back and now I'll just have to pick up the pieces, especially now that we're in a pandemic which makes all of the above harder. 

So to anyone reading this, go through the *pain* of discipline. Get up early, focus on your craft, save money, move out and gain life experiences. Or you surely will go through the *pain* of regret where you look at all lapse of time and realize that you're still the same person with the same issues that you had over a decade ago.",r/getdisciplined,You will either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.

1hzeskz,"Stop overthinking - act now, iterate, act again, iterate... and keep going. That’s it. That’s the whole game.

Everyone wants the cheat code for success, but here’s the truth: it doesn’t exist. You don’t win by planning the perfect start or waiting until everything’s just right. You win by starting, learning, adapting, and doing it all over again. You win by being a fucking animal.

As the once-great Conor McGregor said: ""I am not talented, I am obsessed.""

Joe Rogan didn’t start with a £200m Spotify deal - he started with a dodgy webcam, childlike curiosity, and a couple of mates talking nonsense. Fast forward 2,000 episodes, and he’s bigger than every TV host combined. Absolute animal.

Dyson? He didn’t wake up one morning and invent the perfect hoover (yeah, I know “hoover” is technically a brand - don’t come for me, I’m British). It took him over 5,000 tries, but he got there. Animal.

And MrBeast? Easy target for his school bully, no doubt. The guy spent years grinding on YouTube, uploading videos to an audience of fuck all. But he didn’t quit. Kept tweaking, testing, learning. Now? He’s cracked the code and turned into a full-blown beast. Or animal (sorry, had to do it).

Even the Colonel - yeah, the bearded bloke - didn’t start flogging chicken until he was 65. Rejected over a thousand times. A thousand. He might just be the biggest animal of them all.

Here’s the thing: everyone wants to win. Most people love to plan, maybe even start… but hardly anyone sticks around for the long game.

The grind? It’s ugly. It’s boring. It’s demoralising. Those tiny wins? They trick you into thinking you’ve cracked it - right before life delivers a swift kick in the nuts.

Persistence wins. Success isn’t about perfect plans; it’s about pushing through when others quit. And, of course, the researchers had to spell it out for us: a 2023 study by Boss et al. confirms what we all already know - entrepreneurs who persist through setbacks are more likely to succeed. Apparently, persistence isn’t just grit - it’s about iterating through failure and taking small steps, even when you feel stuck. Groundbreaking stuff.

Simple? Yep. Easy? Not at all. Nike didn’t start as a giant - they began pouring rubber into a waffle iron in a kitchen. What the hell’s a waffle iron, you ask? Lucky for you, I googled it. (Who am I kidding, I ChatGPT’d it - honestly, they need to come up with a better verb for that).

For the uninitiated (maybe just me), a waffle iron’s just a gadget for making waffles - crispy, grid-patterned squares you drown in syrup. Or Nutella if you’re feeling cheeky.

So, how’d Nike use one to make shoes? Simple. They were messing around in the kitchen, pouring rubber into the waffle iron to create shoe soles (as you do). Sounds like something you'd do after a few too many, but somehow it worked. And that’s how Nike iterated to a wildly successful product.

Facebook was a glorified phone book for uni students.

Top Gear ripped into Tesla’s first Roadster, calling it a dodgy go-kart with battery problems. That “go-kart” is now patient zero for the EV car virus (who’s triggered?). It wasn’t perfect, but it was the start of something massive.

Most podcasts don’t make it past three episodes. Most businesses don’t survive five years. But the ones who stick around, who persist, who adapt? They end up dominating because everyone else was too busy looking for shortcuts or chasing shiny objects.

So stop waiting for the stars to align. Forget perfect. Perfect is boring. Start messy, learn as you go, and keep showing up. That’s the difference between the people who dream about success and the ones who actually live it.

Now, stop reading this bollocks. The winners aren’t here - they’re out grafting. Quit procrastinating and get back to work.

kl6kr8,"Last year (2019):

* I had no skincare routine
* When I actually read, I only read middle grade and YA books (this includes rereading Percy Jackson for the tenth time)
* I never exercised
* I oftentimes forgot to brush my teeth twice a day
* I rarely ate a vegetable
* I had to turn on the TV to fall asleep

Now:

* I complete a researched skincare routine twice a day
* I read not only twice the number of books, but almost all of them were classics (somehow even managed Moby Dick!)
* I exercise twice a week
* I brush my teeth twice a day no matter what
* I eat at least one serving of vegetables a day
* I meditate every day, as well as use special meditations to fall asleep every day
* I started to practice stoicism
* I just generally took better care of myself

Obviously, I am not perfect now (need more exercise and vegetables, mainly) but I made huge strides this year.

Yet NONE of these was my 2020 resolution. I had only one resolution this year, because rarely have I ever stuck to a resolution, and I wanted to make it INCREDIBLY easy this year. So, what was that resolution?

It was flossing.

Hear me out. I have flossed almost everyday this year and will continue to do the same in the future. But how did flossing cause me to get my life together? The reason is very similar to the *diderot effect.*

For those who don’t know, Diderot lived in the 1700s and was very poor. Then Catherine the Great offered to buy his library for a large sum of money (side note: she let him keep it, and just borrowed books from him). With this, he bought a new scarlet robe. He loved the robe, but soon found that all of his other possessions looked drab in comparison to it. Slowly, he began replacing things in his house with higher-end items that would better match his robe. Before long, Diderot didn’t have any money left.

When we buy a nice item that doesn’t match other items, we will start to replace the other items. This is called the diderot effect.

A similar thing happened to me, only the end result was not debt. I made the resolution to floss, and was determined to keep it. Even if I remembered after I got in bed and was about to fall asleep, I would get up and do it. I made it so there wasn’t an option, as I had already made the choice when I made the resolution. After a little over a month, I was getting the habit and didn’t dread it anymore. So, in my own eyes, I became something more, I became Someone Who Flossed™.

Pretty soon, my nighttime routine looked pretty drab in comparison to my newfound identity (kind of like Diderot, right?). At first, I just made sure to brush my teeth twice a day so that my hard work in flossing wasn’t undone. Then I decided to start a simple skincare routine. To do this, I happened to buy a product with salicylic acid in it that helped my acne significantly. Because of this, I got super into skincare and started a full-fledged routine by browsing [r/SkincareAddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/) and skincare videos on YouTube. After a month, I became Someone Who Had a Skincare Routine™ as well as Someone Who Flossed™.

These became a part of my identity, but other parts of my life were looking bad in comparison. Also, in my mind, people who floss everyday and have a skincare routine not only have their life together, but are just more advanced at life. Because of this I tried reading more adult-level books, like The Shining and 1984. Then I picked up Crime and Punishment and fell in love. For the first time, I realized old classics are actually very interesting and fun, especially Russian classics. Thus, I started reading only these (and I’m still working my way through the most popular classics). As a result, I became Someone Who Reads Classics™.

I think you all see the trend here. Exercise and meditation were added after I took that free Yale course, “The Science of Well Being” (which I highly recommend).

What does this mean for you?

Maybe other people can have a similar experience, in the same way Diderot’s experience became common. If anything, you could make it your resolution to floss this upcoming year, like I did. Otherwise, pick a different, very easy resolution that you associate with people who have their lives together. Even if you want to have other resolutions, just make this one the one you don’t have a choice but to stick to. Worse comes to worse, nothing else changes but your dentist is very happy with you.

I know this sounds a little gimmicky, but it really worked for me, so I wanted to share. Let me know if you have any questions.

Tldr: The resolution was flossing. I changed everything else to become the type of person I thought someone who flosses was. It’s kind of hard to explain concisely, but it’s similar to the diderot effect.

Edit: I'm so pleasantly surprised at the number of people saying they're going to do this as well. Please feel free to comment your progress (or lack of it) on this post in the future. Also, I want to emphasize how long this process took. I only added a second habit after two full months of flossing.

lboq8b,"Look. I know you think you were born damaged.

I know you’re convinced that you’re weak and pathetic given your lousy track-record of self-control.

I just want you to know—no, *I need you to know* —that none of that is true. You’re not broken, in fact you’re the opposite of broken. You’re functioning *exactly as you were designed*.

All those vices you’re consuming; all that procrastination; all that binging on Reddit, then Youtube, then streaming TV; it’s just your way of pacifying and coping with that constant pain and unease you feel 24/7.

It’s not just you who feels it; it’s all of us.

So where does this pain come from? Why are we so restless and unsatisfied? It’s not like we’re lacking in anything fundamental. It’s not like we have much of a reason to feel this way, right?

It’s kind of messed up, but we—humans—were *designed* to be perpetually unhappy.

More accurately, we just fell into being this way over millions of years of evolution. Like how natural selection brought us opposable thumbs and peripheral vision, the same survival forces brought us this constant hum of discontent.

The reason for this is simple: motivation. Evolution favored our discontented ancestors because they worked harder; they were more likely to survive. Their dissatisfaction and unhappiness fueled their motivation to get out there, take risks, use energy and change things for their advantage.

A perpetual hum of discontent was thus wired into our species with the sole purpose to be motivated.\*

I know what you’re thinking. *That’s all great for cavemen or whatever, but this doesn’t apply to me. I’m miserable as fck, and yet I feel the opposite of motivation. Most if the time, all I feel is a depressing apathy.*

I know that feeling all too well.

I encourage you to take a step back for a second. Look beyond you bubble and your daily self-discipline attempts and failures. Instead, consider the world around you and put things in proper context in terms of how our environment has changed since the days we roamed the African Savannahs.

When our ancestors were motivated to relieve the discontent; when they decided to do something to scratch the uncomfortable itch of a craving… *They had to work for it.*

They had to take on risks and endure long and dangerous missions and quests. In their world of scarcity and danger, relief never came easy. There was always a cost of time (days) + energy (thousands of calories) + risk (potential death).

The trade between the time/effort/risk and reward was balanced.

Today, it’s a whole other game.

With our modern-day vices, the cost of reward has been eliminated. The time to reward is now seconds; the energy involved is the fraction of a calorie it takes to tap a screen; the risk non-existent.

This sounds amazing—and in many ways living in our modern utopia of abundance and security really is exactly that—but this has consequences. There are side effects.

On the societal level we have the obesity epidemic and unprecedented rates of addiction, depression and anxiety. **Since we don’t have a frame of reference of what it was like before, we’ve collectively decided to shrug and say, ‘this is normal… humans are just impulsive, irrational, lazy and inherently ungrateful creatures.’**

But this is **not** normal.

Normal was: you were fearful, dissatisfied, horny and hungry, so you were motivated to seek out and protect against predators and other dangers; you formed tenuous but crucial alliances; you found and courted a mate (while trying not to get killed for approaching the wrong one), and you hunted for what sure as hell did not want to be hunted.

Normal was: you did all those things, you hopefully survived another day, then you went to sleep utterly spent but with a brief moment of serenity and inner-satisfaction.

Normal was: you woke up to a new set of needs and threats, but luckily dissatisfaction was there to motivate you onwards.

Things have changed for us in the blink of an eye. We now live in the *abnormal*.

Abnormal is: you feel fearful, dissatisfied, horny and hungry, so you’re motivated to… grab your phone, scroll through news and outrage comments on Reddit and Twitter, feel pings of pretend status with social media, fap to 14 hyper-fertile women, and inhale some ultra processed and high caloric food.

Abnormal is: doing all those things, which works insanely well and fast to quiet and numb the inner discontent, but then it snaps back up and so you’re compelled to do them again and again and again until you blunt your brain’s pleasure receptors making it require even more for the same relief and reward.

Abnormal is going to bed with nothing substantial to show for your day; ruminating and stressed from procrastinating on all your modern obligations and long-term worries—paying the rent, getting good grades, landing a job amidst record unemployment, getting fired because a robot can soon do your job, bracing for the next economic collapse…

Abnormal is then waking the next day, with the same heavy burden, but with the same wired ‘motivation’ to relieve it quickly, but mistakenly and temporarily and *stupidly*, through your vice.

We live in abnormal times. We just weren’t made for this place.

So what’s the solution?

Now that you learned and know what’s going on. You can start by forgiving yourself.

Breathe a little sigh of relief.

Allow for some much needed understanding and compassion. You deserve it.

Step two is to adapt to this reality.

First you can deal with the low hanging fruit.

Webblockers.

This might seem odd, but as much as strive to I love myself and am grateful for who I am, et certera, I DON’T EFFING TRUST MYSELF. The self I'm talking about is my spongy brain matter that evolved for a different world—the part makes drives impulses, makes snap decisions; the part of me that thinks opening Reddit to a fresh set of tantalizing posts right when it’s time to work, is a good idea.

I stopped trusting those impulses and clever rationalizations and excuses; but I’ve since learned it's a clever bugger and knows how to override my conscious attempts to ignore it, so I put up some obstacles.\*\*

Next, I put certain systems in place.

I work with a modified Pomodoro technique where I book-end each session with instances of being mindful of my thoughts, feelings, emotions. This has proven to be key. Just observing all that inner discontent and its motley crew of ill feelings—craving, Resistance, regret, anxiety, boredom, overwhelm—and allowing for some space to respond, rather than react and grab at a vice for relief, has been huge.

Sure, being mindful of those uncomfortable feelings is, well, uncomfortable no put it mildly—but that’s the price I must decide to pay every day. The trade is fair: a little pain and discomfort in exchange for some motivation to do meaningful work (like writing this post). It’s an investment; one that pays off later in small doses of happiness and peace of mind.

bbr86u,"One tendency I've noticed about a lot of us who are into self-development is that we are incredibly hungry for information.

Some of us may have had neglectful parents or an upbringing that was very scarce, we may have not gotten the encouragement for self-betterment, we have no one around us who are striving for the best -- so we want to consume and process all the information, methods, tips, and tricks we can.

I think that's great because being deeply desirous to change yourself is better than being apathetic and lethargic.

Unfortunately, this over-consumption of information can become gluttony. Gluttony then leads to lethargy, which then leads to sloth and not doing anything with this information.

More books! More articles! More podcasts! More lectures! More, more, more! I need to know the secrets of the universe before I end up starting my business, before I apply for that job, before I take that trip, before I ask out that girl.

We need to be perfect and then, then we'll act. One day. One day.

But one day never comes. Neither does perfection.

The real truth about self-development, the real pain is the application. It's in the messy interactions between imperfect human beings.

You've read what's in that book about dating. Now, go out on a Friday night and apply it.

You've read how to start a business. Now, start your own.

A lot of people are dreaming with their heads up in the clouds, thinking they're moving the needle when they're just reading a book or an article online.

How many people are out there actively trying, failing, getting knocked down on their ass, and trying again? Very few.

Most people read about a diet in a book, try it for 2 months, then relapse into their old eating habits.

Many people say “I'm gonna meditate for 20 minutes a day” but they “can't find the time...because Netflix”.

Then people wonder why 2019 is 2018 is 2017 is 2016. Repeating a fucking Groundhog Day existence for 30 years.

Then you'll be 68 years old and realize that you just twiddled your thumbs in your ivory tower while your life passed you by.

Because the real pain of self-development is exertion, it's doing it when you don't want to do it, it's progressively getting better and actively cutting out areas where you don't need to be doing things.

What methods work? **They all work.** There are some that are more ""optimal"" than others, but they will all work - if applied. If you read a self-help book starting from ground zero (like you know **nothing** about this stuff), you will be a better person on page 258 than you were at page 1. I guarantee it. So it's not about ""choosing the right methods"". It's about **application**.

There are people who think self-development and self-help is a joke. These people have never even walked into a book store and yet they're laughing all the way to the bank or living the life that we want to live!

I can pretty much guarantee that if you took one book like Deep Work or Psycho-Cybernetics and applied everything in there to the T, your life would dramatically alter.

You wouldn't need to be browsing Inc. magazine for the newest hacks. You wouldn't need to go on Entrepreneur and say you're “hustling”.

We need to throw ourselves into the task with everything we have and not look around for another hack or tactic to help us when we have an arsenal of 1,000 inside our head.

hfoes5,"Procrastination is something we all do. So is feeling bad about procrastination. But here's the crazy thing: even though this is a shared human experience, it's a sign that our approach to self-discipline is to shame ourselves and beat ourselves up, rather than understanding *why* we procrastinate.

##Procrastination is not about laziness, but task avoidance

The first thing to do is to realize that procrastination doesn't make you lazy. **Procrastinating means you associate this task with pain.** 

That's it.

> ""We believed that it was poor time management and that if we just worked a bit harder and had more self-discipline, we could do the job,"" [said researcher Tim Pychyl]

[Source: the CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-for-june-14-2020-1.5604357/there-s-a-reason-we-procrastinate-and-it-s-not-laziness-1.5604433?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

The solution is not to work harder, to sit there and painfully force yourself to get to work. **All this does is associate your task with pain.** You're punishing yourself for taking on the task, and you're only reinforcing the negative association.

Approaching it this way, it's only a matter of time before you avoid pain and revert to reward-seeking behaviors. It's how we're all wired. 

You're not lazy. You just have the wrong associations for this task.

> So it's about our feelings, it's not just a matter of buckling down and getting it done. **There are negative emotions associated with doing a set task and we know how to get rid of them: avoid the task.**

So what do you do? 

**First things first:** stop punishing yourself for procrastinating. Stop feeling like you're lazy. Stop beating yourself up and saying ""why can't I do this?"" Instead, realize that you just have your wires crossed. And you need to know how to uncross them.

##A quick method for undermining your urge to procrastinate

So if procrastination is the result of bad associations, what do you do to fix it? You have to train yourself to make a positive association with the task itself. [Here's how Terry Crews does it to work out two hours a day](https://lifehacker.com/terry-crews-fitness-secret-treat-the-gym-like-a-spa-1744582572).

> **It has to feel good.** I tell people this a lot - go to the gym, and just sit there, and read a magazine, and then go home. And do this every day. Go to the gym, don’t even work out. Just GO. Because the habit of going to the gym is more important than the work out. Because it doesn’t matter what you do. **You can have fun — but as long as you’re having fun, you continue to do it.**

Now this is good advice, and it became viral, but I would argue that for people with extreme procrastination, even going to the gym when you can just chill at home sounds like a task worth avoiding.

In dog training, we use positive reinforcements to slowly and incrementally build up your association of a specific task with feelings of reward and pleasure. For this example, we'll use ""cleaning the bathroom,"" but you can apply this to just about anything you procrastinate with.

* **Use laughably small tasks, if you must.** If necessary, start *stupidly* small. For example, let's say you always procrastinate cleaning the bathroom. Start today by telling yourself that you're going to walk into the bathroom - that's it, just walk in. 
* **Practice making the smallest tasks rewarding.** Do your laughably small task. Next, reward yourself with a pat on the back, or play some music, etc. The goal isn't to clean the bathroom, remember. It's to associate cleaning the bathroom with good feelings. That starts by just associating the bathroom with reward, not with ""ugh, I have to clean all of this stuff."" Don't take on a big task that feels painful yet. You want to undo the association of ""work = pain."" Don't expand the task until the laughably small version of it feels rewarding.
* **Give yourself a reward cue.** For example, if you set an Alexa timer for five minutes of bathroom cleaning, use that timer as the cue to give yourself a reward. You'll start to associate the feeling of that cue with being free and having a task completed, as well as the reward itself. You'll know this starts to become a habit when you start to picture the task itself by imagining how good you feel when that cue hits.
* **Always keep the pleasure outweighing the pain.** You can slowly add more work into this routine, but make sure that you keep the rewards heavy, especially at first. They should outweigh the pain. The sooner you revert back to ""work = pain"" habits, the sooner you'll revert back to avoidance and procrastination.

Does it sound like you're training yourself? Good. Because that's exactly what you're doing. Dog trainers do this with dogs all the time; they slowly introduce ideas at first (like getting used to a harness). They don't put the harness on the dog right away. They introduce the harness, associate it with a reward, and slowly and incrementally build on that until the dog associates harness time with positive rewards.

You're more sophisticated than a dog, of course. But it doesn't mean that you're exempt from this rule. 

Procrastination is not laziness. When you procrastinate, it's because it's *exactly* what you feel you should be doing. You're just succumbing to feelings of pain over feelings of reward.

It's the feeling associated with the task that's the problem, and it's why even breaking something down into bite-sized chunks isn't quite enough. The task has to be associated with reward if you're going to keep coming back to it.

**tl;dr** Procrastination isn't laziness or a character flaw. It's basic task avoidance. We avoid tasks because we perceive them as tasks of pain, not reward. Progressively change this association by breaking it down into small, (and also highly rewarding) tasks and you'll overcome the urge to procrastinate. **And make sure to avoid beating yourself up for starting a task and not finishing it.** That only makes a negative association with starting work.

ku0nlf,"From the Japanese writer’s point of view, “writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity,” spending his days running and swimming to build up his endurance, as well as competing in marathons and triathlons.

At the start of his writing career, Murakami also ran a small jazz club in Tokyo, where he worked until the early hours of the morning, before going home to write.

After he decided to commit his life entirely to writing, Murakami and his wife, Yoko, closed the bar and moved out to Narashino, a more rural area in the Chiba prefecture of Tokyo.

From there, the writer overhauled his lifestyle and daily routine completely, “once I was sitting at a desk writing all day I started putting on the pounds. I was also smoking too much—sixty cigarettes a day. My fingers were yellow, and my body reeked of smoke. This couldn’t be good for me, I decided. If I wanted to have a long life as a novelist, I needed to find a way to stay in shape.”

In Murakami’s new daily routine, if he’s in novel mode, he’ll wake up at 4am and immediately start writing, working for five to six hours. If he’s not in novel mode, Murakami and his wife will still wake up early, “once I began my life as a novelist, my wife and I decided that we’d go to bed soon after it got dark and wake up with the sun,” typically waking up before 5am and going to bed at 10pm.

While some people may imagine the life of a writer as balancing long stretches of idleness with flash in pan inspiration moments, the reality is that writing, and creativity, is more of a steady grind. Murakmai says, “I have to pound away at a rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of my creativity” — a sentiment which reflects his structured routine and lifestyle.

Murakami will typically finish up his day’s writing at 10am or 11am. From there, he’ll proceed to his physical training.

>In the afternoon, I run for 10km or swim for 1500m (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9:00 pm. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind. But to hold to such repetition for so long — six months to a year — requires a good amount of mental and physical strength.

1. **Recognize** it (is it anxiety? is it stress? Where in your body do you feel it the most?)
2. **Accept** it (the feeling is already within you; trying to distract yourself from it or trying to reject it is only going to make you suffer more---you don't have to keep doing this to yourself. Peace is *beneath* the pain within you. Peace is not outside of you)
3. **Investigate. Listen** to it (ask it: ""What are you trying to tell me? What do you need the most right now?""). Then *listen* as if you were listening for a top-secret message being whispered by a tiny kitten (listen with utmost care, attention, and Love for yourself)
4. **Nurture** it (love yourself through the pain. Remind yourself of what you are capable of doing. Remind yourself that if you *don't* know what to do, you can always seek help. Just love yourself here, however feels most healing to you)

j6xes5,"1. Your self-love must be stronger than your desire to be loved:

If you're not happy now, there's no amount of followers, positive social media comments, or Instagram likes that will change that. External validation isn't happiness - it's a
hamster wheel. Validation is an inside job. The most convincing sign that someone is truly living their ""best life"", is their lack of desire to show the world that they're living their best life.
Your ""best life"" won't seek external validation, but insecurity continually will.

2. You are always responsible for your emotional reactions:

If you get angry and say ""X thing made me angry"", you will get angry often.
If you get angry and say: ""I made myself angry because of X thing"" you will get angry less often.
All of your emotional responses are your
fault and responsibility. Nothing can make you angry. Your thoughts about what
happened made you angry. That's on you. If you realize that, you'll have the power to control it. If you don't, you'll spend your life triggered easily and unhappy often.

3. Don't feed your problems with thoughts, starve them with action:

If you want to feed a problem, keep thinking about it.
If you want to starve a problem, take action.
Most of the harm starts in your mind, with you and your thoughts.
Most of the solutions start with a decision, courage, and action.

4. Life has an algorithm too:

Just like social media has algorithms to give you more of what you're interested in, life has an algorithm that gives you more of what
you're thinking about and focusing on. You can train your algorithm to make you more anxious, worried, or insecure by focusing on negative things.
You can train your algorithm for happiness, success, and growth by focusing on positive things.
Your thoughts become your decisions and then your actions your focus becomes your future.

5. If they're real,
they'll want to see you win:

If you ever feel nervous telling a friend or partner your good news, don't. Get new friends or a new partner.
You can't afford to have people in close proximity that don't want to see you succeed, grow, and progress.
They'll subtly hold you back with snide comments, negative feedback, and casual pessimism.
In the short term, they'll have a small effect, but in the long term, they'll lead you away from your potential and towards the same negativity that has consumed their lives.

6. Your life will be defined by your ability to handle uncertainty:

To get from a miserable place to a happy place, you have to be brave enough to travel through a scary, vulnerable, lonely place called uncertainty.
Choosing uncertainty over the certain misery of your current situation is a decision you'll have to make many times if you want success and happiness in work, love, and life. You'll be defined by your ability to handle uncertainty. Avoidance all risk is the biggest
risk. Don't fear the unknown.

7. You have nothing to ""find"":

""Finding yourself"" is a pop culture lie.
""Finding your passion"" is a pop culture lie. ""Finding your soulmate"" is a pop culture lie.
These pop culture lies, and the perfection they promise us, if we would only keep searching, stop us from working through the natural challenges within our careers, relationships, and within ourselves.
There is no perfection, only room for improvement.

8. Your mental diet will determine your mental health:

Comfort eating on negativity will make you unhealthy, and mental weight is the hardest to lose. Like fast food, negativity often tastes good in the short term, but will make you unhealthy in the long term.
Your mental diet consists of what you watch, what you read, who you follow, who you spend time with, what you say, and what you think.
If your goal is to have a healthier mind this year, start by removing all the junk food in your diet.

Then a few days ago I stumbled upon [Huberman's podcast on dopamine](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU). It didn't directly touch on discipline, but understanding how dopamine works was the key for me to 'getdisciplined'.


Practical take-aways that have been working really well for me: 

1. To get started, break up high dopamine activities. **Don't layer high dopamine activities**. Spread them out. e.g. Porn, break, masturbate, break, drink. This counts for healthy activities too. Don't eat and watch your favourite show at the same time, even if it's healthy food.
2. **Don't peak your dopamine before or after work/study**. I'm trying to learn Japanese. It's hard and boring. But only because I do high level dopmine activities before it and/or after. If you drop those, or do them later on in the day, after only a couple of days studying becomes a lot easier and more fun. The activity itself gives me the most dopamine.
3. **Don't start your day with a high dopamine activity**. So studying first thing in the morning is a good idea. Maybe meditate or do something you've always wanted to get good at. This allows you to slowly raise your dopamine level, cementing that activity in your mind as pleasurable. Don't forget rule 2 though.
4. If you're completely unmotivated; **move first thing in the morning**. Go for a walk. Movement releases dopamine (without cause too much of a peak). Have a warm shower and gently make it as cold as you can handle. Warm up through movement after. This raises your baseline dopamine for several hours so you can get things done.
5. **Look for things you're grateful for (about what your doing) while studying/working**. This gives you small peaks of dopamine that train you to enjoy what your doing, even if right now it's kinda boring. Give it a couple of days.
6. **Don't reward yourself every time**. This one's a bit counterintuitive, but the (expected) reward will spike your dopamine and make the activity itself less pleasurable. If you then don't get the reward for some reason, the activity will seem less attractive. Randomise when you get the reward. This is why gambling and lootboxes are so addictive, use it to your advantage. Personally I haven't implemented this point yet, I just don't reward myself.

1n5pz5j,"The straw broke the camels back last night and I guiltily feel almost relieved about it. For context;

My husband (33M) either cannot or will not prioritize me (29F) at all. We have been married for almost 8 years. I’m not expecting to be treated like a queen, but I want to be treated like I’m actually his partner in life. 

My husband is a blue collar worker who works a family business in the construction field. Because it’s a family business there is seemingly no boundary between his work and personal life. It’s like he’s married to his job. Anniversary trips have been canceled the day before because he needed to work, he couldn’t pick me up from surgery because he needed to work last minute, he has canceled every date I’ve tried to plan in the last 4 years because he suddenly has to work (I gave up a year ago though), etc. It just seems like every time I try to plan something to spend time with him, he suddenly needs to work and cancels on me last minute. I constantly feel like I’m being stood up for prom, but I’m his wife? 

But it’s not as if he only prioritizes work and flakes on his friends. There are much too many examples of how he has been able to make plans with his buddies to meet up and drink beer, smoke cigars, shoot the shit. His friends will call him and invite him on spur-of-the-moment week-long fishing trips, and my husband will leave work immediately to pack and hit the road. But when I wanted to go to a nice restaurant for our anniversary—one evening—he told me the night before that I needed to cancel the reservation because he would be working late. It makes me feel like he prioritizes spending time with his friends over me because he’ll easily blow off work for them, but he never does for me.

I also feel like he prioritizes his goals over mine. He has taken out loans for the family business’ sake using our joint money without even talking to me about it first. This has happened 3 times. All through our dating relationship and engagement he told me he wanted children. After we had been married 4 years ago, I told him I wanted to start trying for a baby. He told me he never wanted kids and he had always been afraid to tell me because he didn’t want to lose me. But now I feel like he took away my option.

I really do appreciate how hard my husband works. But I just wanted to spend time with him and have time made for me, like he’ll do for his friends. I have made peace with the fact that I may never be a mother, I am not sure if I’m being petty about this entire thing but I feel like he robbed me of my best chance and years for doing it, at the very least. 

I told him in April that I wanted to get a divorce and I explained why, but I told him I was willing to do marriage counseling. He told me he wanted to do marriage counseling with our pastor. So we did and my husband’s biggest issue with me is that I’m disorganized. It’s true, I have ADHD and often lose things. I’m trying to work on it. My husband also complained about our sex life, but I tried explaining that I’m rarely in the mood because he ONLY ever touches me when he wants to have sex. Never wants to hold hands, hug me, kiss me, etc. So now I cringe when he reaches for me because I know it only because he wants to have sex. And I think because I was the one asking for the divorce, I was seen as the problem/trouble maker. The pastor was convinced that I had some romantic comedy script in my mind and I wasn’t being realistic about what it means to run your own business. I had to work on being more understanding, patient, and on lowering my expectations and standards. I feel like all I had been asking for was to be treated like a priority and not an afterthought.

But the straw broke the camel’s back last night. We have been planning to go on a long weekend trip with my siblings and their spouses this upcoming weekend. Two days ago my husband told me he had to work this upcoming weekend and couldn’t go on the trip. Nevermind that it’s non-refundable at this point. I said okay and would see if I could get a friend/cousin to come with me instead. Then yesterday, he came home all giddy and excited. He told me a buddy of his just called and and invited him to a weekend bachelor’s party this upcoming weekend!!!! 🎈🎉🥳🎊!!!!! WOW! He is so excited to go!!!!!!!!! Except…the guy he’s going to celebrate is someone he has told me he dislikes on multiple occasions. So he canceled going on a weekend trip with myself and my family because he has to work, but he immediately agrees to go on a bachelor’s trip for someone he *dislikes.* Like he literally chose someone he dislikes over his wife? Maybe I’m the one he dislikes.

I am not sure if I’m being ridiculous about why I want to leave, but I now no longer care. I’m indescribably unhappy in this marriage and it’s time for me to make a plan and get out. I still feel like I’m young enough that I am not starting completely over, and I’m very thankful we don’t have children. I feel relieved that it’s going to end now.

1jzrxmg,"A 400-year-old Samurai philosophy called Kyojutsu tells about how to never rely on willpower or discipline to get things done.

Instead, it works through three surprisingly humane ideas:

* Laziness is an illusion
* Resistance is information
* Strategic positioning > brute force

And what we call laziness is usually the mind doing a risk-reward calculation behind the scenes.

If the task feels unclear, misaligned, or emotionally heavy, your brain signals: don’t do it. But instead of interpreting that signal, we label ourselves “lazy” and try to power through.

The Samurai didn’t do that. When they paused, it wasn’t procrastination but perception. They used resistance like a compass.

If you're constantly battling yourself to “just start,” maybe it’s time to stop fighting, pause, question yourself and start listening.

“Is my resistance about the method, the timing, or the purpose?”

mvfgpv,"The way you’re thinking makes perfect rational sense.

You don’t like your current life; you don’t like the way things are going—from your day to day behaviors and habits, to your obligations and the vision of what your life will look like a month, a year, 5 years from today—so… *so*… you want to make big changes.

You want to *use* that dislike, to leverage it, and get it to induce self-discipline and propel you towards a better life.

I hear you. I’ve been there.

Perhaps you’re on a career path that doesn’t interest you. At times you friggin' hate it. So you want to use that hate to push you into working on something you’re *actually* passionate about.

Maybe your self-image—the way you see your outer body and inner self-worth—is at an all-time low. You want to use that discontentment to drive you onto better habits.

And of course you compare yourself to others—we’re humans and that’s just what we do—so you can’t help but feel down about all the fun, success and peace of mind they get to enjoy while you're relegated to the sidelines. You want to use the envy and resentment and vehement desire to stop procrastinating and take action to get a slice of that happy pie.

Like I said, your logic here makes sense:

>I don’t like the way things are going today → therefore I will change using that dislike as fuel. I will use the resentment, pain and yearning to break out of this eternal rut.

The things is (and I learn this the hard way btw) this doesn’t work.

As Marsellus Wallace would say “You came close but you never made it. And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.”

So let me say it plainly.

Motivation can’t be fueled by negativity.

*Motivation cannot be fueled by negativity.*

The reason for this is simple. **Negativity only does one thing: it drives you to your vice.**

Think about your past. What happens when you felt anything remotely painful or uncomfortable? What were you compelled to do? You reached for Reddit, YouTube, social media, Netflix, junk food... right?

This is what is hard-wired in your mind: resentment, yearning, regret, worries, stress, unfulfilled desires… they can all be instantly relieved with your vices.

No matter how much your conscious mind yammers away about the little investments needed to actually deal with these things, your subconscious, the emotional part of you that *actually* drives behavior, will just laugh and say, “Hmm, I guess we *could* do it your way… or…*or!...* we could fix things now and with zero effort. Yeah, we’re just going to go with that.”

…

But wait.

People do make changes, right?

The obese guy loses 100 lbs. The alcoholic cleans up and now spends her time volunteering as a sponsor. The delinquent teen changes course and becomes a successful entrepreneur.

So how?

Here’s the thing. Here’s what took me *years* and an immeasurable amount of struggle, pain and denial to realize and fully accept:

Positive changes in behavior, leading to tangible improvements to your life, they are much more likely to happen if you are perfectly content with the way things are.

Let me say it again.

**Positive changes will happen once you’ve accepted the way things are.**

*Huh? Like, that makes no sense. I mean, why would anybody makes changes if they were content with the way things are?*

I just see it as another one of life’s cruel paradoxes (but that make perfect sense once you come to live it).

Motivation only works forward. It won’t show up if you’re obsessed with wanting to move *away* from a life or career path you hate and resent.

It’s a cat. It won’t come if you chase it out of your petty needs—if it feels like you are desperate for it.

No, you have just to let it be. You have to first figure out a way to be at peace with the present moment. Accepting of the way things are.

Only then will the motivation and energy for more and better show up.

…

While this perplexing (and frankly *inconvenient*) truth takes time to root in your mind, I’d like to share a bit of my story which exemplifies this to a T. It’ll also show you how I came about breaking out of my rut—what I did and what tool I used—despite that nagging paradox.

So let’s go back to 2007. I was in school, on a career trajectory in which I was indifferent to at best, and *absolutely loathed* at worst. And it was usually the latter.

Like you, I was painfully aware of (and tried to be grateful for) the many blessings and privileges I was born into, yet I pretty much hated my life.

I was miserable. I longed for a way out.

And then it came.

There it was on display at the bookstore. *The Four-Hour-Workweek* by Timothy Ferris. A little book promising me a way to quit the rat race of a conventional career and join in on a thrilling life of being my own boss and travelling the world.

I can still take myself back to those moments, sitting on a grassy hill on campus under a warm sun, cracking it open for the first time, my mind slowly erupting with ideas.

Potential. So much dam potential, it was unreal.

Soon after, my life became split in two.

There was reality… school and then the career part of my life, my obligations, the stuff I hated, *that I loathed* , but that I just had to do (and boy did I procrastinate on that stuff).

And then there were the fantasies. The dream life. *The side project*. My ticket to freedom. I just needed to ride it for a while and I would get to the promised land.

But I kept falling off the dang train.

So it went.

For years. Idea after idea. One step forward, 8 steps back. Failure after failure.

Frustration, desperation, depression, apathy, anger. As the years went on, this off-hue rainbow of negative emotions would aggravate and amplify. Each time I began a new attempt to break out of my rut I willed them to motivate me—to propel me to work, to get me to get sh\*t done once and for all.

It never worked.

The more I tried to use that negativity, the more I tried to force myself out of a festering resentment of my life, the harder I crashed when my willpower got spent and I snapped back down, while of course, bingeing on my vices.

...

Fast forward 13 years. April 2020.

I had just come back from a travel sabbatical. It was the second time I took time off my day job to free up time and dedicate myself to a side project. Once again, things never took off, not even close.

It wasn’t because the market didn’t want my product; it never even got to that. For much of the trip, motivation evaded me and my bad habits took over. Resistance (aka that ‘*ugh I just don’t feel like working’* feeling) was my biggest enemy. I never stood a chance.

So after the usual sad fanfare, I decided to yet again to give up and go back to my day job.

There was however going to be a difference this time. I decided to take a step back and challenge my decades-held assumptions and beliefs.

I spoke to people, first some friends and eventually a mental health professional. I spoke about these beliefs—plucking them from where they festered unmolested for decades and exposing them to the light of scrutiny and reasoning.

Here’s a fun exercise: take some belief that 17-year-old you came up with as a coping mechanism and attempt to explain and justify it to someone. You’re going to have a hard time.

So yeah. I slowly began to realize that the truth was caked over with years of stories I was telling myself. Years of me insisting that I hated my career; years of me seeking and holding onto scraps of evidence that it was boring or hard or unfulfilling—that I hated every aspect of it and there was nothing redeeming about it.

With help, I did the work of taking a pick-axe to all of those layers and I discovered the truth: there is nothing inherently wrong with my career.

If I focused squarely on the present moment—which by then I had started making a habit out of when I discovered mindfulness as a means to manage depression—there was never anything *wrong* with it. My job was always just ‘insert this number in that Excel box’. Then ‘write this word, then that word'. Then ‘deal with this person by email’, etc.

It wasn’t actually this abhorrent boogeyman that my immature mind conjured up years ago as a juvenile response to the realities of adulting. Yes, it wasn’t my passion. Yes, is was often boring AF. Yes, it didn’t allow for me to live on a beach in Argentina like Timothy Effing Ferris. But it *just wasn’t that bad.*

Even when it did ‘suck’, even when it got objectively tedious, or stressful, or frustrating, I always had a choice.

The Buddha says ‘suck’ aka pain is inevitable. Suffering is not. Suffering is how you respond to pain. And my default for over a decade was to mindlessly wallow in the pain. To ruminate and tell myself I hated this and this would be my future forever and ever. My beliefs lead to my suffering. Simple as that.

But that wasn’t the truth. The truth is, *it isn’t that bad*. Come to think of it, it was fine. It was stable and secure. It paid the bills and allowed me to live comfortably during the evenings and weekends. The stress could be reduced with simple time management practices and an open conversation with my manager every now and then.

So, when I returned to the job, I decided to just let it be. To come in without any prejudice. To rediscover, moment by moment, as much as I could whether I really did ‘hate’ my career.

Turns out I didn’t. Turns out I don’t.

Then… when I least expected it, guess who came sauntering into my life all casual, like no big deal. That little f\*\*ker of a cat.

Motivation.

…

Today, as I try to maintain this mental calm of acceptance and gratitude of what is—and again I hold no delusions, there are times when it does indeed suck—I find myself infinitely more motivated and less inclined to procrastinate. The work just happens.

Now, when the Pomodoro bell chimes after I churned out a solid hour of work, I get up and I fist pump the air while telling myself how awesome it is to be able to exchange some honest work for a fair wage.

...And that’s for my work-work. My obligations.

It’s still too early to speak of a great success story for my side project; but one thing is certain. I don’t have motivation issues anymore. I mean, the fact that I woke up at 5:45 am to finish up this essay is a little testament to it.

Whether it succeeds or not is beyond my control and the odds are stacked against it; but funny enough, I don’t care as much as I once did. I don’t *need* it to work anymore, lest I be doomed. I’ll be fine either way. It’s the work I like; if a little fruit buds out of it, even better.

I sincerely wish the same for you.

\- Simon ㋛

I think we need to focus on the 24 hrs rather than a month or two to see changes.

Have an end goal in mind but focus on today. You have 24 hrs to change your tomorrow and make it more predictable. 

Rather than thinking it will take a month or two to see the changes, think about today. Just the 24 hrs, forget everything   else.

The reason we procrastinate a lot is because we want to see quick changes and knowing it will take time will make us have second thoughts or just procrastinate more. Instead, just focusing on the 24 hrs allows us to see more changes quickly since a day passes quicker than a month. 

So if you workout today, get the project started today, etc. At the end of the day you can look and see the changes you made in your life within a day. Then next day again it starts from zero and again you put efforts and see the quick changes.

ljyrge,"A month ago I finished *A Monk's Guide to a Clean House and Mind* by Shoukei Matsumoto, and it has had a pretty sizable impact on my focus, productivity, and well-being.

Like many on r/getdisciplined, I have had good weeks and bad weeks trying to better myself and instill new habits.  Until I started cleaning regularly I didn't realize that merely having a messy room, no matter whether I was in it or not, was affecting how I treated my habits, my relationships, and myself. For me, cleaning is now the foundation for all of my other habits.

Some notable things that I really enjoyed from Matsumoto's book are the following:

* Monks make a habit of cleaning every day, using it as a time to commune with nature and oneself.
* How one cleans is a reflection of one's heart
* When cleaning, monks do not wish to be somewhere else or doing something different.  They focus on making the best of the tasks they have in front of them

Cleaning can be a difficult task to start with, as it often feels like it's getting in the way of things that have a more tangible result.  However, the peace I've felt from focusing on cleaning has rippled through my life in how I organize everything and has quickly become one of the most important tasks on my to-do list.

l9yp3m,"I saw this quote a couple of weeks ago and it hit deep.

In my younger years, I had the misconception that sticking to habits and disciplines restricted my freedom and wouldn't be any fun.

After graduating college with no job lined up and no skills to back it up since I did the bare minimum to graduate and partied a decent amount, I realized the freedom I sought actually created more stress and problems.

I spent the next few ""adulting"" years frantically devouring self-development books, learning and implementing habit principles and systems religiously (with plenty of failures along the way), and came to the conclusion as Jocko Willink noted, that the true formula is ""Discipline = Freedom.""

A fitness habit may seem to be taking away your energy and time, but it actually energizes your life force and allows you to experience more of life.

A reading habit may seem to be boring, but it is actually multiplying your future income and making you an indispensable professional.

A healthy eating habit may seem restrictive, but it is actually allowing you to indulge in desserts and fried foods occasionally without guilt.

A saving habit may seem no fun, but it is actually giving you options to make career and life pivots in the long run even if there is an economic crisis.

Easier said than done, but when you honor your disciplines frequently or even better daily, it will protect you like no other in the face of life's unpredictability and thus giving you true freedom.

I wished someone would have told me earlier to invest in my daily habits, rituals, and disciplines as it was truly a game-changer.

mefzbm,"# The Key to Habit Mastery

Humans are innately wired to take the path of least resistance, and it seems most things in the universe have this bias.

Water and electricity flow through the path of least resistance.

An object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force.

A person binging Netflix will stay lying on their ass unless acted on by an outside force.

If we look from an evolutionary context, our bias to be lazy has good intentions.

Primal man did not have UberEATS or Dominos Pizza delivery on standby – Every day was a bitter struggle for survival.

A human who expanded their energy doing unproductive things like dancing in a tree for several hours or digging random holes was more likely to get eaten by a sabre-tooth tiger.

Meanwhile, his ‘lazy’ friends had the energy to run away.

Modern humans, through the rapid advancements of civilisation, have been blessed to focus on the higher rungs of [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.).

The problem is our primal programming still persists.

You want to start a new habit, but the older regions of your brain demand otherwise.

The same brain that saw tree dancing as a waste of time now sees exercise,

studying, journaling, business creation and meditation as the biggest possible waste of your energy.

Remember, this brain is wired for short-term gratification not long-term fulfillment.

Primal man likely didn’t even have 30 years to live so everything had to be optimised for the now.

A trick needs to be employed to counteract this old programming and get the ball rolling.

**The 2-Minute Rule**

If you want to start a new habit, commit to doing it for only two minutes.

Two minutes is a small enough window to overcome much of the mental resistance.

The key to making this work is to allow yourself to be satisfied with doing just two minutes without judgement.

You need to see the two minutes as a legitimate success.

When we attempt to create a new habit we often set high expectations of ourselves.  
We want to:

• Exercise six days a week.

• Cut out all carbs from our diet cold turkey.

• Start programming an app with minimum programming experience.

• Create a business that makes $20,000 per month without ever making $20.

Unrealistic goals require too much willpower to maintain. You might stick with them for a while but eventually you will give up.

The 2-minute rule allows you to first create the habit before going deep.

Once the initiation of the habit becomes subconscious rather than conscious everything is suddenly easier.

**A Business Parallel**

In business, companies are willing to spend a large percentage of their money on acquiring a new customer.

It often costs a fraction of a marketing budget to retain an existing customer.

Existing customers (for example people who love Coke) can stay with a brand for several years or even a lifetime.

A devout lover of Coke is unlikely to replace Coke with Pepsi, even if Pepsi might taste better.

Coke to them occupies a place in their minds which is incredibly difficult to remove.

You can see the same pattern in people who are devout followers of Apple’s iPhone; they tend to avoid Android like the plague.

It doesn’t matter if an Android phone objectively performs better than their iPhone.

They will still fight vehemently for their brand like Mongols under Kublai Khan.

The point here is **the mental battle is the hardest to overcome**.

Once your mind accepts a product or habit as being a part of your identity, loyalty becomes the inevitable response.

**How I used this in my life**

For a long time I struggled to make yoga a habit.

I wanted to gain some of the benefits of the practice but could never get into it.

Periodically I would start and stop the habit.

Getting on the mat and doing foreign poses for 30 minutes was a tedious task.

After failing to be consistent for several months, I decided to commit to just doing 1 or 2 poses every morning (downward facing dog and child’s pose).

I did this for a week or two and then started adding other poses to my little routine.

After a month I was averaging 20 minutes every day.

I knew it became a habit when it felt **wrong** going to bed without doing yoga for the day.

I employed the same approach to journaling.

I first committed to writing one or two sentences about the day and listing the foods I ate.

With time, the journaling practice got more elaborate and it became another daily habit.

**Your Blueprint**

1. Find a habit that will improve your life.
2. Allow yourself to do the bare minimum (2 minutes) per day.
3. Do the habit every day until it becomes enjoyable.
4. Naturally add more variety and complexity to the habit.
5. Experience the amazing long-term benefits.

dndnjr,"Ok so it was a while when I stumbled upon a book called ""Running on Empty: Overcome Your Childhood Emotional Neglect"" by Jonice Webb(thank you, a redditor who advised it). I couldn't be fanboying over it more.
 It was an amazing read. It can be helpful for anybody here, who comes from a normal family, wasn't blatantly abused physically/mentally, but still finds themselves in a dark place overeating, overspending, procrastinating, showing signs of depression, etc. This book can explain A LOT, I swear. Or, not this particular book, but anything concerning childhood emotional neglect.

Self-discipline, knowing when to rest and when to work, forcing yourself to do something when needed, etc - all of these are SKILLS that you simply might not have been taught. Lack of them doesn't mean that you are ungrateful or dumb, you just. Don't know how to do it. Because you were never taught! 

On my own example: I come from a regular okay family, I've been granted a lot. If I'm not successful, that's on me, right? Except for...
How was I supposed to be self-disciplined when my parents were working day and night and I was mainly on my own? A child can't figure this out themselves. My parents never checked my homework so I never bothered to do it, and therefore never developed a sensible work ethic. 
Or: I was assigned to a bunch of additional courses after school, so I must be hella educated? Well, I never really had time to know what I like MYSELF, so when I got just a bit older I dropped every single of it, tired - never knew what was I supposed to do later, so I was just doing nothing, chronically. 
Such tiny things no one on earth would think of as bad? They grew into some huge fuck-ups. 

Now, I'm not saying my parents were evil. They were doing their best and they wanted the best for me and for the most part, they did great. But! such small things add a lot to the final picture when summed up.

 Sometimes it's not about your parents doing something, it's about them NOT doing this. While there is really no one to blame, it's not the point; what matters here is that you realize the reasons why you act in the certain ways, what are the roots of your habits and behaviors. To recognize these small things done when you were young and trace them to your adulthood, and actually FIX them.

Hope it was helpful:)

Update. The book itself has a separate chapter on discipline, but I would advise to read the whole thing, the chapters on emotions and childhood, self-soothing, etc, since the material is very educational(at least to me).

Update 2. There was another related book mentioned as eye-opening, *""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature parents""*. I haven't read it myself yet, but you may want to give it a shot as well!

Update 4. Damn guys, I low-key expected a lot of responses because of the intimate matters being concerned, but not this many! I'll just say that I'm very proud of each of you, for bothering to read it, for seeking answers even in the darkest of days, and for making it this far(in this post, or in life). This book or any other one may not be panacea, but I hope everybody will find something important in them that would allow to continue rocknrolling. Though the whole therapy and psychological analysis thing tends to be mocked and reduced to ""haha mommy didn't love you? man up"" nowadays(in my perception, at least), it shouldn't be brushed off blindly. No parent is perfect, if you feel hurt, then there is already a solid enough reason for it, and you should treat it carefully, even if you think you're just being weak, not trying enough etc. Okay, be weak! Be sensitive!

**Questioning Motivation**

&nbsp;

If I have your attention, do me a favor.

&nbsp;

Think back to the last time you were motivated to do something. 

&nbsp;

It doesn’t matter what you were motivated for. It could have been to take the trash out. The point is to recall the last time you were putting *something* off, over and over again. Always promising yourself you’d get to it, just *later*. 

&nbsp;

- Finally going to the gym and eating healthier. 

- Finally taking school seriously and studying like you never had before. 

- Finally breaking your addiction to porn, cigarettes, alcohol, or food.

- Finally putting the time in to look for a job.

- Finally taking that step to becoming more social and extroverted.

- Finally taking the time to clean your apartment, bathroom, or room.

- Finally taking the initiative to wash all your clothes.

- Finally stepping up to take the trash out.

&nbsp;

Do you remember *why* you got so fired up? So motivated to finally make a change, take that action, make that jump? When before, all you did was put it off, promising yourself you’d start tomorrow. Do you know why you finally made the choice to say “No”, and get your ass moving?

&nbsp;

More importantly, do you ever wonder why you can’t get back to that point? You search and search for different motivational methods to get inspired enough to get back to that mindset you had once before. When nothing could take you off the path of success. When you felt invincible, as if someone finally woke you up to your purpose, and all was clear.

&nbsp;

That feeling is pretty elusive.

&nbsp;

For a lot of people, myself included, we only get those huge surges of motivation once every few months. When we’re forced to sit down and look at our life, and realize we aren’t where we want to be. We aren’t happy, we aren’t fulfilled. We’re in pain of our circumstances, and so desperately want to change, it hurts.

&nbsp;

Well;

&nbsp;

It wasn’t the combination of words from that speech you were listening to on YouTube. Though if we’re honest, those words were pretty inspiring and encouraging.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t that song you were listening and bumping to that did it either. Though, you’d love to hear that song again, just in case.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t the chapter in that self-help book you read and totally resonated with. Though, damn, you felt so understood, that surely had to be it?

&nbsp;

It wasn’t even that talk you had with that important person in your life. Though, you really should get together and talk with them again.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t any of those things. Not in themselves, at least. If it were, you’d feel that same rush of motivation, of drive, of fire, *every* time you heard that speech, listened to that song, read that book, spoke to that friend.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**The Secret**

&nbsp;

What got you motivated enough to take action, was your imagination.

&nbsp;

*”Oh God. This guys on some woohoo mystical bullshit.”*

&nbsp;

That’s a fair opinion to have. But for those of you that haven’t clicked away, do me another favor. If you can, try and remember what your thoughts looked like when you were deeply motivated. Not when you were promising yourself to do that thing, only to procrastinate until it was too late. Remember what your thoughts looked like just before you got highly driven, and finally took the actions towards improving. 

&nbsp;

The thoughts you had while listening to that speech. Listening to that song. Reading that book. Speaking with that friend. The words, lyrics, or beats themselves weren’t what motivated you. It was what you were envisioning in your head *while* doing those things. 

&nbsp;

- You thought about how unhappy you were with your current life.

- You thought about all the changes you wanted in your life.

- You thought about how much better your life could be.

- You thought about all the things holding you back.

- You thought about the steps you’d need to take to achieve that change.

&nbsp;

And more powerful than that, you imagined and envisioned in your head.

&nbsp;

- You imagined what your life looked like after you succeeded.

- You imagined how your friends and family would react.

- You imagined how you’d get all the girls/guys.

- You imagined how your lifestyle would change.

- You saw, in your imagination, the life you wanted. 

&nbsp;

**You were in your own head. Creating the motivation you needed, within yourself, by reflecting over your own emotions, feelings, and desires.**

&nbsp;

That’s why you have such a hard time getting motivated, and only seem to be truly driven and inspired once every couple of months. Because normally, you’re simply looking for a band aid. For a  quick fix solution, a new method you haven’t tried yet. Because while you know in the back of your mind you want more, you aren’t focused on it truly.

&nbsp;

It’s only during those deep dark periods, when something drastic happens to you. You get a notice from the doctor about your health, and your life is in danger. You run out of money, and don’t know if you’ll be able to pay bills this month. Your relationship is crumbling, and you fear you’ll never find someone to love you.  Nothing is going right for you, and life is constantly beating you down.

&nbsp;

You’re forced to look at your life. To reflect on all your past decisions. To truly weigh where your life is at. And you aren’t happy. You aren’t satisfied with your circumstances. You aren’t proud of what you reflect upon. You thought you’d have had more. Achieved more. Created more. Shared more. Expressed more. Lived more.

&nbsp;

It’s in these moments that we’re truly motivated to change. To finally take action towards our own improvement and development. 

&nbsp;

Not because of a speech, of a song, of a book, or a conversation. Not in themselves at least. It’s what they cause you to feel, to think, to imagine.
 
&nbsp;

Motivation only works when you anchor it with what you truly want for yourself. And not only that, but by then envisioning how your life can change, what your new lifestyle is like, and what steps you need tot take in order to achieve that success. Most importantly, motivation only works when you continuously reflect on those visions. If you only reflect once every few months, when you’re truly down and beaten, you’ll only feel that drive once every few months.

&nbsp;

However.

&nbsp;

If you fueled your soul with that passion and drive to succeed, each and every day, imagine how your entire life would change.

lgulvq,"You tell yourself *Ugh I have so much work to do today—there’s just no way I can squeeze in a workout…*

… you end up wasting hours scrolling through Reddit. Clearly a workout would have been fine.



You tell yourself *Ok, deadline in 8 hours. I just can’t believe how I could procrastinate so damn much—I had 2 weeks. I just need to sit my ass down, stop being an idiot, and just get this stupid thing done…*

*…* you proceed to somehow rationalize checking YouTube— \*just gotta get it out of my system —\*and by the time you resurface the deadline is now 4 hours away.



You tell yourself (after waking up cold in the middle of the night)… *I need to put on a t-shirt.*

… you proceed to put it on backwards. *Crap. Every time*.



What do all these scenarios have in common?

Well, for one, they’re all things I’ve done a thousand times over. Especially that last one. The odds are *supposed* to be 50/50, but I swear my record’s gotta be like 90/10 for getting it wrong.

More importantly, all of them could have been avoided. Not by being more motivated. Not by having more willpower or grit or determination. Not through a fancy method or an app. Not even by transforming into the better person you dream of being.

No. They could have been avoided *by going slower.*

Taking a moment to feel for the shirt tag takes time—it’s the slower way to go about putting on a shirt in the dark. But in the end, if you sum up all the minutes spent taking off, rotating and putting back on a shirt, you’d for sure conclude it’s actually the faster way.

Taking a minute to recoup after procrastinating on something; taking a second to allow for a little compassion and understanding, to exhale and remind yourself that you’re human and humans do illogical and short-sighted things; all that stuff burns a lot of time. So does going for a walk and returning to your desk without any inclination to force it; fully content with just sitting there mindfully observant of all the inner chaos; allowing the stress and panic and frustration and resistance do its thing; let it twirl around your mental space, then wash out.

Finally, not trying to cram an unrealistic amount of work in a day; taking the time for yourself and for your physical and mental wellbeing; that’s definitely the slow way at getting stuff done—but only if you make the assumption that \[productivity = butt in seat × number of hours\]. Yet, if you look at exercise and other positive lifestyle habits as an investment, one that slowly compounds returns in increased focus, creativity and those rarified *‘hey! I feel like working now!’* mental tokens to be redeemed the next time you sit at your desk, then you could argue that the slow way is really the fastest way to success.

…

So, if I could leave you with one lingering idea; one little proverb for you to pull out from your mental wallet whenever you catch yourself rushing through life, thinking *bah, I don’t need to check for that friggen shirt tag, it’ll be fine* —it would be this:

Go slow, to go fast.

If you want to go fast; if you want that desired outcome, your dream life, to arrive in the shortest time possible, the fastest way *is* the slowest way.

*Go slow… to go fast.*

ul26za,"When I was in college, I had an assignment due for several weeks and being the procrastinator that I was, I obviously waited until the last day to get started. Due time was at midnight, so I woke up early that morning, brushed my teeth, took a shower, made coffee etc., all while priming myself to get this assignment done. I opened my laptop and then… things didn’t get done.

&#x200B;

I spent hours dreading the work, looking at everything and nothing all over the internet, all to avoid getting started. Just one more video turned into a whole 8 hours of doing nothing productive at all. The stress and guilty feelings got worse and worse every passing minute. It got to the point where I started feeling physically ill. I was so overwhelmed and stressed that I just closed my eyes and tried to calm myself down. This wasn’t about the assignment anymore, I just needed to relax, or I was going to implode.

&#x200B;

I stopped thinking about the assignment. I stopped worrying about worrying. I just focused on relaxing. One thing at the time. And then when I opened my eyes, it all suddenly made sense. The pain of not doing my assignment was outweighing the pain of doing it. So I decided to just open my assignment and stare at it. I stared at it until I got bored (like a solid 2 minutes of just starting at a blank page on my computer screen). And then I just started typing.

&#x200B;

The assignment was done in (I kid you not) 3 hours. 3 hours. I spent 8+ hours making myself ill worrying about doing work for 3 hours. And I recall it wasn’t even painful to do, it was relatively easy actually. Ever since that day, whenever I procrastinate, I try to think of this moment. The pain I was feeling, it was real. I try to remember this one simple thing: The pain of not doing something outweighs the pain of doing it.

lfbg7z,"  When it comes to matters of discipline we tend to punish ourselves when we fall short of our goals. 

If we procrastinate on doing important work for what seems like the 100th time, we say,

*“Dam I’m such as lazy F\*\*\*.”*

When we skip our scheduled gym workout, we think,

*“No wonder I’m getting fat.”*

Our role models wake up at 4AM, run several businesses, and are in peak physical condition (all whilst having ideal social lives). 

Their seemingly perfect life reinforces our feelings of inadequacy.

*How can they figure it out while I stay stuck?* 

We treat ourselves like shit because we have never been taught otherwise.  

To us we see our lack of discipline as being an innate problem - not the result of an ineffective strategy. 

# The Truth 

Your lack of discipline is not a personal characteristic, it’s the result of several complex factors including:

* Upbringing (how your parents treated you growing up)
* Friends (their discipline level and standards affect your outlook)
* Your society (societal expectations and mass programming)
* Brain chemistry (we have different brains, duh!)

You did not choose the circumstances into which you were born, but you do have the power to transform yourself. 

# Discipline is fundamentally an awareness issue 

Whether you are trying to quit smoking but continue to light cigarettes, or you keep prioritising Netflix over important tasks – Your lack of discipline boils down to your lack of awareness.

If you do not possess the level of awareness needed to stop a destructive behaviour, you won’t be able to change your patterns.

Let me give you an analogy.

The difference between a good basketball player dunking hoops at your local court and a player in the NBA is their level of awareness as it pertains to the sport. 

Through practicing for thousands of hours the NBA player develops a mastery of the court. At the highest level, the professionals play from their subconscious minds.

What looks like calculated actions to us are more often automated reactions that have been created through deliberate work. 

Their brains pick up far more data than other players giving them a serious skill advantage. 

This is why you might physically be more capable than Michael Jordan but still lose to him 999 out of every 1000 games (you win a single game when MJ trips over a rock). 

# So now what?

To increase your level of awareness you need to study yourself like a scientist. 

Each time you find yourself engaging in a negative habit, pay attention to the thoughts and emotions that preceded the habit. 

Were you stressed?

Maybe you were bored or feeling disappointed?

Take note of this information (journals are good for this).

Also consider the feelings you had after your finished the habit. 

Did you feel a sense of relief? Or did you feel more energised? 

Every habit aims to fulfill a particular need. 

Only by becoming aware of this need can we start increasing our ability to be more disciplined.

Through analysing our actions we can start to find ways to overcome ineffective strategies.

As time progresses, you will find that you have more tools to deal with the negative habit.

Eventually, you will notice impulses rising way before you engage in the habit. 

Awareness is what gives you options, and with time your success will be automatic. 

# The Main Message 

If you have never played basketball before you wouldn’t expect to make it to the Olympics. You sure as hell wouldn’t beat yourself down for being a rookie. 

If you have not consciously worked on your discipline with the same gusto Einstein had when he was working on his relativity equations or Dave Chappelle when practicing his stand-up, then don’t beat yourself down when things don’t go your way. 

Be kind to yourself and focus on getting those hours in.

ipzwdd,"What if I told you that the next time you feel the urge to procrastinate or to grab that cookie, rather than dread or fear that feeling, to turn toward the experience with curiosity and really observe and get close and personal with what's actually happening in your body and mind that moment?

This mindfulness tactic may actually help you curb that craving the next time you face it.

I watched a talk on mindfulness by Dr. Brewer, a psychiatrist, and I wanted to share what I learned with you all because it has been helping me out a lot.

According to Brewer, being curious and exploring your habit engaging behavior actually helps you see what you get when you engage in that behavior and eventually, become disenchanted with your behavior.

Here is an example:

In one of Dr. Brewer's lab studies on smoking addiction, he had subjects (who had previously failed to quit smoking several times) focus on being curious about the experience of smoking, rather than forcing themselves to not smoke.

When one subject began smoking and truly tuned into what was happening in that process, she came to realize that smoking smelled like stinky cheese and tasted like chemicals- actually tasted like shit.

She had gone from knowing smoking was bad just in her head, to knowing it was bad for her viscerally in her bones.

And study results back up this example- **mindfulness actually turned out to be twice as effective at helping people quit smoking as gold standard therapy.**

So the next time you are hit with a craving, instead of looking for a way to make it go away, pay attention to how you are feeling both physically and emotionally in that moment, and continue to do so while you engage in your habit.

Perhaps you will then find joy in letting go of that behavior.

You dream of breaking through that pre-set mold: *get a job, play it safe, retire*.

It’s not just you.

You’re surrounded by similar people on this sub. Artists and creators and entrepreneurs. All vying for their chance to give their gift and make the world a better place.

>I want to write a novel, but never got every far. 

Setting ambitious goals is great, it’s indeed necessary if you want to grow and accomplish great things. And if it’s a little scary, that’s good. That means it’s out of your comfort zone. That means it’s worthwhile and has the potential for real impact.

But, there’s an issue. ***When it comes to execution, to actually reaching that goal;*** ***at best we procrastinate to no end, and at worst, things fall completely apart and we quit.***

Big goals invariably create a bigger problem.

They lead to you being pummeled with overwhelm. Staring at a giant wall to climb, you can’t help but feel intimidated, behind and discouraged.

Still. We try to shake off the feeling. We put it in a box. We look at the ones who’ve made and try to replicate their steps. *Want 100k subscribers to your channel? Post, post, post and post some more. Don’t stop. I too was once a nobody.*

But the emotions can be paralyzing. Poring your heart and soul into something then allowing yourself to be vulnerable to criticism, or worst, to crickets—it's not easy.  It’s no joke when things don’t go as well as you hoped. It's take a lot of stamina to persevere.

In the end it’s not the haters out there that’ll get you to quit; if only it was that easy. No. It’s the little goblins inside your own head, taunting you with *you're good enough* until you finally give up.

…

So, TLDR of the above is: it’s great to say “*I’m aiming for the stars!!”,* yet when you barely clear a tree stump after jumping as hard as you can, it can be crushing to your moral.

You need a way to get there. Not a shortcut (doesn’t exist). Not a boost (inspiration is overrated). But a *way.* A method.

**I call it logarithmic goal setting—or log goals for short.**

When it comes to achieving goals, the conventional advice is to chunk it down. Mince it up into a long list of workable and repeatable tasks and objectives.

Big goals will provide for you a vision and direction. They provide you with a North Star.

This is good but it’s not enough. It would be like going for a hike using only a compass to B line it directly to the summit. You’re gunna hit a tree or fall off a cliff at some point. You also need a map and a physical path to follow.

The idea of log goals is to first **break your goals into levels of difficulty and complexity. Then figure out the list of tasks,** ***but only for the first level.***

This works best with quantifiable goals (‘lose 100 pounds’, versus ‘lose weight’).

Losing 100 pounds is crazy intimidating. To achieve that you’d nee to ???? buy some books? hire a trainer? clear your pantry? buy only kale and—\*checks blog—\*quinoa? Post a crazy vow to Facebook??

It’s OK to *want* to lose 100 pounds, for that to be the end goal, but to start off, instead ask yourself, **how do I lose 1 pound?** This where you’re at: Level 1.

Figure out how to beat Level 1. Ignore the rest.

Once that’s done (and you have that first bit of momentum), you’ll be at Level 2. When you get there—and again not a minute sooner—ask yourself *how do I beat Level 2*? Which can be to go from 1→10 pounds lost.

Level 2 is a notch up in difficulty and complexity. But by then you’ll have gathered some lessons, skills, confidence, slightly better eating habits, etc.

Once you beat Level 2, which may take a while, then you could take on the final boss: 10→100 lbs. Level 3 is hardest of them all, but, in keeping with a video-game analogy, by then your character strength will be increased, and her inventory would be filled with items to use when confronting the final boss.

…

Let’s go through this again, but with an example from above: making it as a musician.

As you know, that goal is too vague, so start by breaking it down into measurable sub-goals. Get to 250 000 Spotify listeners. Reach 10 000 Instagram follower. Make 2000$ per month in income.

Let’s focus on the first sub-goal (250K Spotify listeners) but the process can be repeated for the other two.

**Step 1:** decide on how many levels this game will have. You can count the number of 0s if it's a multiple of 10 (so 10 000 would be 4), or just go with 5, which is what I do.

**Step 2:** Map out the metrics for the various levels. The idea is to go with some sort of exponential growth. You can do this roughly. Start with 1, then 10, then maybe 150 and continue until you get to the final goal.

If you like math, you can use the formula F = G^({1/L})

Where:

* F = a growth factor
* G = the final big goal (so 250 000)
* L = number of levels (so 5)

For this example, plugging the variables into a calculator, we get F = 12.011. So the series would go 12, 144, 1732, 20812, 250 000. You could use the numbers as is, but I usually round it up. I'd go with :

Level 1: 0 → 10

Level 2: 10 → 150

Level 3: 150 → 2000

Level 4: 2000 → 25 000

Level 5: 25 000 → 250 000

**Step 3:** Figure out level 1.

Forget about the rest—that’ll come when you ‘graduate’ to each next level.

It’s ok to have no fricking idea how to get 250 000 Spotify listeners. But, you *can* figure out what to do to get 10 music lovers eager to listen to your stuff and subscribe.

Brainstorm. Consult that how-to-make-it guide you bought. Write out a plan.

The fact the goal is now mini should clear things up for you in terms of activities. Do you need an intricate website? No. Do you need to find a music agent? No. Do you need to buy a 5000$ microphone? No. Do you need to get better at what you do? Well yeah, but not ""100k screaming fans"" good—you need ""10 hipster 'I liked her before she got big' fans"" good.

That’s doable.

So yeah, will it involve work? Stepping out of your comfort zone? Yes and yes; that was always going to be the case, but I hope you can see that this objective is far less intimidating.

You can start here on Reddit, posting your stuff, writing commentary on music subs, starting up a few DMs with people. You’re looking to connect with just 10 ‘fans’, which could include other budding musicians and audiophiles. There isn't all that much pressure here.

**Step 4:** Execute on that plan until you finish level 1. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as best you can. It might take a while and that's fine.

**Step 5:** Repeat this process for level 2 (10 → 150).

Ok, this is getting a bit more tricky. But, by then again, you’ll have collected some items to use on your quest.

Some collected items are hard: 10 people that have agreed to post your stuff on social media. Insightful and clear advice gleened from someone already in level 3. A sweet website you discovered that helps people find new musicians.

Some items are soft: budding confidence. Little dose of validation and encouragement to go on. New skills you developed and some lessons learned from small success and failures.

With all of that, brainstorm your options then formulate a new plan for Level 2. This could involve similar action items as Level 1 like practicing your craft and contributing to several subreddits, but you can pivot some of your focus and efforts elsewhere. Perhaps it’s time to focus more on Instagram? Maybe you it's time to buy some better gear?

**Step 6:** Execute on that plan until you pass Level 2.

**Step 7 :** Repeat the whole process for Level 3: 150 → 2000

Keep expanding. By then it might be time to start reaching out to blogs or industry influencers.

You can take this on with a ‘trading-up’ mentality: approach and work with small bloggers/influencers... then approach someone a bit bigger using your previous interactions and collaborations as social proof; repeating until you reach trade-up to some of the bigger players…

**Step 8:** Then do the same for Level 4: 2000 → 25 000

At this point, I'm out of advice because frankly I have no clue how one would make that leap. But that's ok. The point is not to have everything mapped from now to when you're headlining at Madison Square Garden.

All you need to have figured out is how to beat whichever level you're on.

7xzy1f,"WOT/Stream of consciousness warning:

All right, so let's start with some context. Way back in 2008 I was like many young men entering their 20s: An underachiever who finally realized he had to take some steps if he wanted to attain the life he wished. Like many young men, I developed an addiction to self-improvement. My first ""hit"" was reading ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss and chasing the idea of becoming the best version of myself. Although I never became the master PUA I wanted to be at the start, I managed to make several drastic changes to my life: I dropped from over 20% bodyfat to under 10% and built a fair amount of muscle, I changed my grades from mediocre (High School) to absolute top notch (University), I managed to stop smoking and cut out some other addictions, I developed a very rigid sleep schedule, and pretty much everything in my life went the way I wanted it to. More importantly: I was extremely disciplined. If I wanted to do something, I would outline a plan and follow it rigorously. In my mind, this was obvious, and I would tell others seeking advice to ""Just fucking do it"". 

However, due to circumstances outside of my control, my progress in my study program was halted, and I spent an entire semester with no clear purpose or idea of where my future was going. I did not know so at the time, but during this semester, I somehow lost my trait of discipline. My habits stuck with me - I got through my master's with honors, and I kept on working out, but It slowly dawned on me that I had serious trouble with applying change to my life.

So, for the next six years or so, I felt that something extremely important was missing from my life. I had this vision of the person I wanted to be, yet I wasn't moving in the right direction. I started feeling guilty about all the time I wasted, and I would periodically (maybe every three months) sit down and write down goals for a set period, week plans etc. I would read about some method online and set out a detailed plan to follow it. And every time, the same thing would happen: I would fail. Every single actual change I wanted, I would fail at. I wanted to get better at running (in contrast to lifting), so I set up a program for it. After a few weeks I realized I wasn't following the program at all. I would come up with an excuse or procrastinate. Every familiar area however, would be no problem at all. I could set up detailed plans and follow them. As this repeated again and I again I started believing that something was seriously wrong with me. Was I doomed to never return to my glory days of discipline?

Then a realization hit me - for the first time in a long, long time. Of course I wasn't getting disciplined - because none of what I was doing actually had anything to do with discipline. 

I remembered a professor from my master's who told us about a study he had conducted on Norwegian top skiing athletes. The goal of the study was to see what separated the winning skiers from the mediocre ones. To everyone's surprise, the answer had been quite simple: The top skiers actually followed the training programs and diets they were told to follow. 

I had everything backwards: Plans, programs, and schedules don't give you discipline - they require it. 

Plans and programs are excellent tools in order to achieve results if you can follow them. But in my case, I realized they were a part of an increasingly vicious circle. This circle went something like this: 

I feel bad about myself not living up to my potential and wasting time. 
I decide to do something about it.
I come up with some method or plan, and typically make goals and schedules for the next week. I spend a lot of time visualizing where I want to be. 
I become motivated and determined, and the anxiety/shame/whatever I feel is gone. I feel like I have accomplished something. I feel like I finally will realize it, this is it. 
I fail to follow said plan
Feelings of shame and failure show up
I distract myself with video games, socialization, or some other activity. 
Repeat 

I suddenly realized why this was happening, and what it actually meant that I lacked discipline. When I felt bad about wasting time - this was my brain's way of telling me that there are problems I need to attend to. Decisions I need to make. Instead of attending the problems however, I engaged in what could only be described as an advanced form of daydreaming. By designing a schedule and thinking about my goals, I created an illusion of myself as being productive that was so powerful that I would trigger the reward system in my brain. This made me feel like I accomplished something, although I actually had not. 

So why did I not follow up? Because I made plans that assumed that somehow, through sheer force of will, I would be someone else tomorrow, and would be able to motivate myself to commit to a long list of tasks. I somehow imagined that tomorrow I would have more willpower than today. But I never did. If I decided to wake up at 6 in the morning - that cost me a lot of willpower! This meant that whatever else I was planning that day was way less likely to occur. And not only that - I had wasted my motivational energy the day before on planning. My imagination had been so vivid that my brain decided to stop handing out motivational energy. 

Not only did my planning sap my motivation - it created a false sense of ""who I really was"" - what my potential was, that haunted me from day to day. Thinking up various daily routines I could follow and how that would make me into a superhuman somehow made me shameful for not doing all of that. And this again made the temptation for distraction more and more powerful. 

In this way, schedules, planning and motivation became just another form of escape. Just another drug for my brain. 

And I finally realized what discipline actually is: It is the ability to recognize anxiety/shame/whatever as a signal from the brain that there is a problem that needs your attention, and immediately go about solving it. It is about recognizing your brain telling you to seek distraction, and paying attention to what is actually happening. What are you telling yourself? What reason are you giving yourself to procrastinate? Can you override it a bit this time? If you do, it will be easier next time. And if you do it enough, you'll start being someone who takes action immediately. 

My biggest reason for procrastination is that I constantly worked out problems in an imaginary, predictable future. I didn't attend what was right in front of me. I made schedules, plans and goals that were motivating to fantasize about, but that actually intensified my shame and anxiety every time I failed to realize them, prompting me to distract myself. 

One important realization that I made was that many of my goals and dreams were false. They exist in a fantasy world based on fantasy ideas about what makes me happy, and what is meaningful. The truth is that I don't know my SMART goals for something I've never done. I don't know anything. I only know that I have a gut feeling that tells me I want to try out something vaguely defined. And that's ok! That's all I need. The future doesn't exist. The only time I can take action is right now. I can't fail, because I have no idea what constitutes success. I only learn this by doing something.

It's actually terribly obvious. When I play video games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, I don't sit down and schedule my day in order to achieve a certain armor or weapon. Still, I work extremely systematically. It appears organically. 

This is what discipline is. Listening to yourself and acting in line with what you want right here and now. 


So does this work? So far, yes. I take action more often, I've done things recently that I've put off for years due to some vague idea that I need to plan how to do it. Turns out I just needed to get started. Not only that, but I'm a lot more content these days. I no longer have the same feeling in my gut of impending failure, or some sort of time pressure to live up to whatever standards I set. I still make plans and use methods - but I use these to solve problems I've already initiated working on, where there's some momentum. 

My point with this post is... I don't know, I wanted to share my experience with someone else. See if anyone else sees themselves in this post.

hchyfi,"It is making a spreadsheet of your debt and enforcing a morning routine and cooking yourself healthy meals and no longer just running from your problems and calling the distraction a solution.

It is often doing the ugliest thing that you have to do, like sweat through another workout or tell a toxic friend you don’t want to see them anymore or get a second job so you can have a savings account or figure out a way to accept yourself so that you’re not constantly exhausted from trying to be everything, all the time and then needing to take deliberate, mandated breaks from living to do basic things like drop some oil into a bath and read Marie Claire and turn your phone off for the day.

A world in which self-care has to be such a trendy topic is a world that is sick. Self-care should not be something we resort to because we are so absolutely exhausted that we need some reprieve from our own relentless internal pressure.

True self-care is not salt baths and chocolate cake, it is making the choice to build a life you don’t need to regularly escape from.

And that often takes doing the thing you least want to do.

It often means looking your failures and disappointments square in the eye and re-strategizing. It is not satiating your immediate desires. It is letting go. It is choosing new. It is disappointing some people. It is making sacrifices for others. It is living a way that other people won’t, so maybe you can live in a way that other people can’t.

It is letting yourself be normal. Regular. Unexceptional. It is sometimes having a dirty kitchen and deciding your ultimate goal in life isn’t going to be having abs and keeping up with your fake friends. It is deciding how much of your anxiety comes from not actualizing your latent potential, and how much comes from the way you were being trained to think before you even knew what was happening.

If you find yourself having to regularly indulge in consumer self-care, it’s because you are disconnected from actual self-care, which has very little to do with “treating yourself” and a whole lot do with parenting yourself and making choices for your long-term wellness.

It is no longer using your hectic and unreasonable life as justification for self-sabotage in the form of liquor and procrastination. It is learning how to stop trying to “fix yourself” and start trying to take care of yourself… and maybe finding that taking care lovingly attends to a lot of the problems you were trying to fix in the first place.

It means being the hero of your life, not the victim. It means rewiring what you have until your everyday life isn’t something you need therapy to recover from. It is no longer choosing a life that looks good over a life that feels good. It is giving the hell up on some goals so you can care about others. It is being honest even if that means you aren’t universally liked. It is meeting your own needs so you aren’t anxious and dependent on other people.

dw13td,"I am an attorney and am 32-years-old. I struggled waking up on-time my whole life. I was always envious of early-bird personalities but as hard as I tried I never was able to be one. If my alarm is by my bed (whether it is my phone or a traditional alarm) I will almost certainly hit snooze and sleep in even on important days. The best I was ever able to accomplish was setting multiple alarms on the other side of the room, but even then it was a 50/50 chance that I would actually get up. If I had an important test or appointment I had to get up for I would have to psych myself up the night before, set multiple alarms, and drink a bunch of water to ensure I would get up on time.

A couple months ago I read Atomic Habits and discovered (learned?) a trick that has worked wonders for me. This is NOT an advertisement for Atomic Habits. But the truth is I did learn this trick from that book and I should give credit where credit is due.

In reading the book I realized that when I wake up in the morning I have no plan other than a vague, ambiguous self-directive to ""stay awake"" or ""start getting ready."" Even though the amount of effort required to choose what I should do next after hitting the alarm was minuscule, it still required more energy than I could muster when I was half-awake in the morning so I would give up and crawl back in bed. I didn't consciously realize this is what was happening until I read Atomic Habits. I then realized I needed to have a clear, very simple and repeatable plan (i.e., a habit) for what I would do *after* I turned off my alarm in the morning. If I planned a follow-up action in advance and did it habitually, waking up would become easier for me. That was the hypothesis, and I'm proud to report that nearly three months later I have woken up 100% of the time, on-time, when I have followed this method.

**The Toilet Method**

I set an alarm (like this one [here](https://www.amazon.com/Peakeep-Battery-Operated-Ticking-Ascending/dp/B073VFBN34/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=basic+analog+alarm+clock&qid=1573688709&sr=8-14) on Amazon) and put it in the bathroom. (I only do this on evenings where I am committed to waking up on time the next morning. If it is a weekend and I would like to sleep in the next morning, I decide the night before that I will not be following this method.) I then remind myself when I set the alarm that in the morning, when the alarm goes off, I will sit on the toilet and pee. After I pee, I will wash my hands. After I was my hands, I will brush my teeth. After I brush my teeth, I will shave. After I shave, I will wash my face. In Atomic Habits, this is referred to as Habit Chaining (which, as the author mentions, is a general concept and not something that he created).

Trigger: Alarm goes off

1. Toilet
2. Hands
3. Teeth
4. Shave
5. Face

By determining exactly what I would do after I hit the alarm in the morning, I removed the need to think and decide in that moment what I would do next after the alarm. Now, when I hit the alarm, I already know what the next step is. I even tell myself that after I do Toilet, Hands, Teeth, Shave, and Face, that I can get back into bed if I am still tired, but I say that because in the five minutes it takes me to do this small routine -- especially by the time I have washed my face with cold water in Step 5 -- I am now awake enough to the point that I am thinking clearly and it is easy for me to find the will power to stay out of bed. So far, nearly three months later, I have been successful 100% of the time that I have followed this method.

This may seem like REALLY basic stuff to people here, but I am 32-years-old and still had not yet figured it out. For the first time in my life, I have confidence that I can wake up whenever I choose. There have even been several occasions that I have needed to wake up very early (4:30 a.m.) and this method has worked great.

**TL:DR** *- Struggled forever to wake up to my alarm clock. Bought a basic analog alarm and put it in my bathroom. Predetermined that when the alarm would go off in the morning that I would sit on the toilet. After using the toilet, I would wash my hands, brush my teeth, shave my face, and wash my face (in that order). In other words, the key for me learning how to wake up to an alarm clock was predetermining what I would do after I turned off the alarm clock (i.e., sit on the toilet), which would ""chain"" into a few other morning activities.*",r/getdisciplined,[Method] I have struggled waking up early / on-time my whole life.

c3w405,"Hello Reddit,

I made this account just to post this. 
First of all, my life 2 years ago: 

19 years old, smoking weed almost daily, failing college, overweight, depressed, social anxiety, didn’t care about myself. Had a nice group of friends who were all the same as me (depressed, lazy, unmotivated). I’d skip class every day to just sit around and play videogames and smoke weed or get drunk. I lived at home with my mom. She enabled everything and did everything for me, including all my finances, cleaned my room, made me food etc. I was a 19 year old baby. Didn’t work out, ate junk 24/7, slept 12+ hours a night, neglected everything in life including personal hygiene. I also was a complete pushover and would do anything to please others. 

Don’t know what triggered it, but i suddenly came to the realization that i can’t and don’t want to live this way anymore. I was completely miserable and used weed/alcohol/videogames to numb myself from reality. I failed college and dropped out, doing nothing with my life at this point. 

In the past 2 years i have changed from a lazy, fat, unmotivated and unhappy guy to a motivated and happy guy. Im currently 21 years old (turned 21 this year). Right now i:


- Quit smoking weed and completely stopped drinking alcohol. Over a year sober from both.

- Work out 5 times a week, lifting weights and cardio every day. Usually in the gym for a little under 2 hours. I lost about 20 pounds and am now in the best shape of my life (a REAL sixpack instead of beer) 

- Work a basic retail job monday - friday 6 hours/day. This really helped me become more extroverted and talking to people is very easy now, i’d recommend this to everyone with poor social skills. 

- Saved a lot of money, spend as little as i can. Currently only pay for my phone, getting a haircut, the gym and sometimes a new piece of clothing/shoes. 

- Worked on my confidence and am now not afraid to say no anymore or go after what i want. (Biggest improvement for me). Retail job helped with this A LOT. 

- Fixed my sleep schedule. I go to bed at 11, fall asleep around 12 and wake up at 8 every day, including weekends. I walk our family dog for an hour first thing in the morning (about 2.5 miles). 

- Started taking care of myself. Shave, shower, use deodorant, fix my nails, brush my teeth morning &amp;amp; before bed, regularly get a hair cut and get my eyebrows fixed (excess hair) 

- Started reading every night to keep my focus on the right things. I read about finance, health, fitness etc. Anything i can learn from. I really enjoy doing this thus its easy for me, i wouldn’t recommend doing this if you don’t like it. 

- Im currently doing research on what i want to study in college next year. I’ll be attending college again in 2020. I have about a year and 3 months left till then. 

All of this sounds great doesn’t it? Yeah, it is. However, after making all these changes i lost all of my friends. They don’t like me anymore and don’t want to be around me anymore. They are still the same way they were 2 years ago so its definitely for the best but it still sucks. I also lost contact with multiple family members who i found out basically hated me for no reason and talked shit about me to others. All for the best, but the problem i have right now is i don’t have any friends anymore and i don’t have anyone to talk to or hang out with besides my mom and my siblings which gets old quickly.

The town i live in is small and everyone knows eachother, it feels kind of suffocating to be honest. Im not interested in being friends with the people around here anymore as they are all pretty much the same way i used to be in the past. They party a lot and i don’t want that lifestyle anymore. I still have 15 months left till i move a few hours away for college and i don’t know what to do in the meantime. 

What i usually do in my free time now is: gym, read, listen to music, watch tv, go for long walks with our dog, go for a run, walk around town and ‘shop’ (look at cool stuff without buying it haha). And chill in our garden to work on my tan. Its ok, but lonely. 

Oh i will also be getting my drivers license this year, starting lessons in 5 weeks!

lv72bb,"To be honest, I am the laziest person I know. But the thing I discovered about myself is that I love when I get in the zone and do what I'm supposed to do. That might be studying, working out, running a 5k, starting business, quitting bad habits and making good ones etc. And I haven't figured out why the hell I procrastinate so much. But now it makes sense.

In my opinion, the reason we all procrastinate is because it's **HARD TO START**.

When I studied for exams, the hardest thing was to organize myself and what will I start working on first. Eventually I would get ""in the zone"" and studying would become very satisfying, because that's what I am supposed to do and it will benefit me on long-term. Us people want instant gratification, for example watching Netflix instead of studying for exam.

From now on I challenge myself first, and yourself too, to do next:

*I don't care if you need to hit that morning workout, or start studying for exam, do the laundry, approach that girl/guy,* ***just start doing it***. *If you want to workout in the morning, sleep in your workout clothes and get that workout as soon as possible before your brain starts to play with you and makes excuses. When you see that cute girl, count to 5, approach her and introduce yourself before you overthink and start making excuses. She might even be your future wife, we never know what could happen.*

tfifk3,"TL;DR: Get the gist by scanning and reading the bold text.

**We all have in our imagination this perfect, idealized version of ourselves. It’s where we’ve finally “fixed” ourselves**; where we’ve become able to practice monk-like levels self-discipline and self-control.

In desperation, we keep turning over every rock of self-help and productivity advice, expecting that *one day* we will come across the perfect method that will “fix” us permanently.

Sometimes you find something promising: a shiny new book recommended on Reddit. It’s great and works… for a short while anyway, until you slip or deviate a little, then a lot, then everything comes crashing down in a fiery blaze of self-contempt.

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to better yourself, but you need to understand that **self-help methods and techniques are “Step 2” of the solution. They won’t ever stick—you’ll forever be stuck in a ""one-step forward, two-steps back” rut—if you don’t start with “Step 1”.**

**Whether you can one day become the idealized version of yourself is a big unknown**—I’m closer today yet nowhere near perfect—**but one thing is categorically certain: there will be a transition period**.

During this transition period you will slip, falter, and come-up-short on your commitments. It's inevitable. **Step 1 is about learning to better react and respond to the consequences of not being perfect.**

Why is Step 1 this not just important, but altogether essential?

**Because much of your “bad” behaviour**—your distractibility, your compulsions to grab at your vices always with a neat and rational excuse—**stems from a feedback loop that is triggered by the slightest imperfection:**

>**You indulge in a vice with a rational excuse** (*lemme go on Tik Tok for 5 mins, get it out of my system so I can focus*)

So what’s the solution?

**We’ve all heard the expression of “sweeping things under the rug.”** It’s where one focuses on the result or consequences of a problem without addressing the core cause to prevent it from happening in the first place.

**Well, there’s no expression for the reverse of that, but that’s exactly what you’re doing.** You’re adamantly obsessed with finding a core cause and cure for all your problems; you’re seeking prevention… while **you’re neglecting to take care of all the mess on the floor.**

Even if you find the most spectacular “Step 2” solution, some mess will still fall as you transition. You won’t be perfect, not right away, not for a long while, maybe not ever. And it’s the mess that’s triggering much of your problem. The mess is what sets you off on these feedback loops of vice that end in wasted days, binges and what always feels like you returning to where you started, but worst.

It doesn’t have to be that way.

We’re lucky. **Us humans have access to a giant rug that can contain a thousand lifetimes of messy spills, fuck-ups, embarrassments, irrational behaviors, bad habits and binges.**

**It’s called self-compassion.**

With self-compassion, you can sweep away your *past* failings. You can come to understand yourself and see how all your past “failings” were done as an understandable coping mechanisms for the pain, stress or worry you’re constantly feeling.

You *deserve* to forgive yourself. You *deserve* to accept and love yourself as you are now, today. If I can’t convince you of this, I promise you that any therapist worth their salt will.

More importantly though, **with self-compassion you can sweep away your** ***present*** **slip-ups, as they happen in real-time and shortly after**. **You can come to accept and anticipate being imperfect, so when it happens you can shrug and move on fast. You don't have to 'start-over' each time.**

…

You, like me, will act in frenetic and impulsive ways. It is what it is. The brain does what it does.

This doesn’t mean that you are morally flawed, broken, sickly or have a bad character. We’re just wired differently, and that’s OK.

We might excel in ways that the kid you see memorizing textbooks for hours doesn’t. He can be focused and still; yet he’s about as creative, expressive and interesting as a microwave-oven. He can *memorize* ideas… but ask him to come up with new and clever ones and he’ll fail.

But not you. You have ideas running through you like busy tadpoles in a stream. They’re slippy and hard to catch, but they’re there. They’re bountiful.

You’re not better, just different. It just so happens that our society—with its report cards and entrance exams and performance reviews—tends to favor the focused kid. But that’s not a hard rule; the exceptions are the ones that actually create beautiful things and drive change in our world\*.

**If you get out of your own way with your self-criticism and learn to accept, anticipate, forgive, and shrug-off your inevitable failures, you too can become amazingly productive and creative**.

You’ll manage to stay on whatever “Step 2” path you choose (see for the one I’m on), because when you inevitably deviate, you can find your way back.

…

I see you. Like you’re in a mirror that projects myself 5 years or so in the past, I see you clearly.

From my side, I can see you scrambling to fix what’s causing the mess of your life. I can see you berating yourself for getting side-tracked from your work 15 minutes ago.

I can also feel what you feel: the pain and regret for being so behind as an adult; the stress of a million obligations and pressures and worries; the frustration from also being incomprehensibly juvenile and impulsive when it comes to vices.

I see you telling yourself, *I just gotta fix this! I gotta fix me.*

But there’s a mess on the floor. It’s causing a lot of your pain and an uncontrollable compulsion to pacify this pain with your reliable vices... which leads to more of a mess and more vice.

You can sweep all that under the giant rug of self-compassion.

Just when you finish, be sure to keep that broom handy. You’re going to need it.

kwh2ej,"Have you ever stopped to question why when, say there’s a big bag of chips open in the kitchen pantry, you find yourself repeatedly moseying over on autopilot? Have you ever *really* questioned that behavior? Gotten down to the root cause?

We tend to joke about such a things. *“I literally have zero self-control or willpower; if there’s a bag of chips open, I’ll kill it in a day despite any promise I made to ration it for the week.”*

Fine, so you avoid buying family-sized bags of chips—*gotta just stick to the dang perimeter when I shop at the grocery store*—but what about all your other vices which can’t be so easily avoided? This is where things get less jokey as a workable solution evades us.

Let's get back to the original question. When we procrastinate; when we waste hours and hours on Reddit or YouTube despite knowing we’re screwing ourselves over, what do we tell ourselves? What do assume is the root cause of our dreadfully lousy actions?

It’s all on us. It's on our lack of self-control and self-discipline. It's on our non-existing motivation and drive. We have some deficiency—we’re somehow broken, lacking some basic inner quality that seemingly every other functional human was born with.

I wish I could tell you it’s not your fault, because it is. Actually, that’s only half correct because *here is the biggest life truth that—once internalized, once applied—changes everything.*

**Unbeknownst to you, the concept of 'you', who ‘you’ are, is comprised of two separate entities.**

First, there’s the Physical self. It's composed of your body and it's spongy brain kept safe and warm in a hard skull. This organ, with it’s neuro-wiring and billions of chemical squirting cells, works to influence your behavior with the sole purpose of you surviving and hopefully replicating.

And there’s the Observing Self; the ‘you’ that doesn’t exist with a physical dimension, but who can, nonetheless, observe.

I feel like I’m about to lose you, so let’s use an example. It’ll seem ridiculous at first, but it’ll make it crystal clear what the heck I’m talking about. And this ain’t a philosophical lecture, so straight after we'll get to where this gets *practical*; where and how this can be applied to yield self-discipline.

Ok. I want you to say out loud (or whisper) the phrase: “there is a goat in the yard”.

Repeat it a few times… *there is a goat in the yard,* *there is a goat in the yard,* *there is a goat in the yard…*

Now, stop saying out loud, but keep repeating it in your head… *there is a goat in the yard, there is a goat in the yard, there is a goat in the yard…*

Keep going. See if you can observe those words. ‘Look’ at them, point your attention to it as if there was a Bluetooth speaker behind you harping out those same words on loop.

Boom. That right there was the two parts of ‘you’ at play. The Physical Self was physically active, as in millions of neurons were fired so that those mental ‘sounds’ could be made. There’s nothing spiritual or metaphysical about this; a scientist could have probed your brain and mapped out the exact sequence of events that were needed to produce that thought.

The 'you' observing all that, the thing removed from it, witnessing the mental sound, *that was the Observing Self.*

Here’s the kicker. **The Physical Self is, and only is, responsible for all your ‘willpower failings’. Not the real you, not the Observing Self.**

You see, the Physical Self... is an idiot. It still thinks it's the year negative 72 000. It still thinks we're all somewhere in the wild Savanna's of Africa where food is *extremely* scarce and threats are coming at you from every angle. So the Physical Self does stuff—literally, it secrets chemicals like dopamine—all with the intent to help you survive in a world we've long ago abandoned.

For example, you eat tasty chips on autopilot because they contain carbohydrate. Where/when the brain evolved, carbs were ridiculously rare and available temporarily (fruiting plants are seasonal). So when you taste some, it triggers an alarm that announces, “Hey! It’s harvest time!! Go go go! Eat as much as possible before the source dries up; more than we need right now so that we can store the excess glucose in some fat cells to have a chance at making it through the long, cold winter.” But the winter never comes. There never was a reason for us to evolve a stopping mechanism; so when our species was thrown into a new era of abundant and cheap starchy foods, the obesity epidemic was the inevitable outcome.

Then there's social media. You peruse social media on autopilot because by thumbing through images of people displaying their fabulous lifestyles, your brain associates yourselves with them. It doesn’t know what a ‘screen’ is, it just takes in visual data and thinks you are there with them; like you are part of their entourage. And being part of an in-group of high status people would be awesome for survival, so we evolved to crave and seek more of it constantly. The brain doesn’t know it’s all fake; that it’s all vicarious.

The same thing goes for porn. I could go on with countless examples but the point I'm making is that all your irrational behavior; all your rationalizing, procrastination and binging; all these things are orchestrated by the Physical Self doing what it thinks it's supposed to do.

But we forget that. Or we don't want to hear it. Instead we blame the core of ourselves, we blame the Observing Self.

...

So we all have some ridiculously outdated wiring aiming at influencing out behavior, thinking it's ensuring our survival, when really it's making us sick and miserable. So how do we get it to stop?

There is nothing we can do directly to make it stop. But we can give it *space*. As Steven Covey writes:

>“Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

This is how I work that quote in my day to day life:

At some point in my day I'll get a craving or an impulse to check Reddit. When that happens, I stop. I sit there and I do what I can to just observe the impulse. I *there is a goat in my yard* the shit out of it until I'm completely detached and just watching it without judgement. Next, with the 10 000 watt lightbulb of awareness, I scrutinize it and question it from every angle.

99 times out of 100, I end up easily rejecting it. I know too much. I know where these impulses are coming from. I know it's just faulty programming, so I just don't trust it. I almost never trust these impulses. I hear the rationalizations and excuses and I call them lies. Manipulations. Trickery.

To be clear, sometimes I forget. Sometimes I still act on impulse. Literally, as I write this, not a couple hours ago I was scrolling through Reddit rather than paying attention at a work meeting. Autopilot is still autopilot and in that periods I was mindless, as in my Observing Self was dissolved into the experience. It happens.

But still, when I catch myself, it's becoming more and more of a habit to detach and take a step back (and I have set up numerous reminders to 'plug into the present moment'). I am able to be compassionate with myself when I falter; to remind myself that I have a brain that simply evolved for a totally different environment, so it did what it was supposed to do (but it's still an idiot).

I can even step back and away from the negative emotions that swells when I falter, and still, I do my best not to identify with all that. I look at those emotions and I say, *ah, there it is… the feeling of stress and regret for procrastinating. Thanks ol’ brain for secreting all that cortisol like a sabretooth tiger is behind me, but it’s actually not needed*. And I wait until it all dissipates. And it always dissipates.

One hour later I realized how little I actually know. Relatively basic questions had me stumbling around like a fool. All the knowledge I thought was only going to ever be on school tests was suddenly being asked of me and I realized I retained almost none of it. It was easily the most embarrassing moment of my life. My interviewer, Seth, was straight with me. He told me immediately that I wasn't going to get the job. He said while I seemed like a good person to work with my grasp on the technical side was too weak for consideration. He was nothing but pleasant, if critical, and I hold him no ill will. But man, was that one hell of a wake up call.

kq9imw,"It was 8:00 am on January 2nd. The holiday festivities were donezo and so was the period of easy excuses to sleep in, and be an all-around lazy blob.

Your New Years resolution was crystal clear: Spend \[some reasonable number of hours\] everyday doing \[a repeatable task\] towards \[an ambitious goal\]. Good. Great. Awesome.

So it was time, not just to talk about these promises, but to execute. To do. So here's how it went that morning:

*Computer is booted up, time wasting site blocker is activated, Word is loaded and good to go. Check.*

*Piping hot coffee at arms reach. Check.*

*Desktop is clean and tidy, che—no wait the stapler is crooked. Ok, there—heck.*

*Let’s do this thi—aaaaaaaaaand holy hell…. uugh… I. just. don’t. feel. like. it. I legit don’t fricking feel like it. What the actual hell…. !! Every time. Why?!*

\*Proceeds to dick around on Reddit instead of work\*

*…*

Sound familiar?

This, amigo, is called Resistance. That overwhelming-repulsion-to-work-that-makes-it-seem-like-the-task-at-hand-is-a-worse-idea-than-licking-the-damp-inside-corner-of-a-bus-shelter-while-setting-it-aside-to-browse-through-r /memes-the-absolute-best-idea-ever?…-*Re-effing-sistance.*

Resistance is a thing, and will come in to punch you in the mouth and sabotage you and your precious resolutions—just like it did last year.

So ok, what to do about?

Well, the way I see it, you have 3 options :

Option 1: Willpower through it. Power through with gritted teeth. Motivation is overrated: just will your hands to move and type, letter by letter, like you’re operating a finicky crane machine in an old arcade.

This is possible, but, like wading upstream of a swift current,  my-oh-my is this exhausting. Productivity prodigies like, *I don’t know…David Goggins?…* can sit down with the beast and barrel through it, but mortals like me and you just won’t have the stamina. No bueno.

Option 2: Do the opposite: indulge the craving for the vice in the hopes that the resistance will pass and you’ll be able to return which a clear brain and a little more focus and motivation.

Lol at this method. It of course never pans out the way you hope, instead snowballing out to all-out binge. Anyway, again, obviously, no bueno.

Option 3: You can *Super Mario the sh\*t out of it*. This is what I do and it works. Allow me to explain.

So you’re 8 again and you’re playing Super Mario World in the basement. You enter a haunted house level (go ahead and play that eerie door hinge sound effect in your head). You advance a bit, when, out from behind you an angry ghost lurches forward. This makes you panic, but you mange to turn Mario around in time  Phew.

Here’s the thing, though. Looking at the ghost doesn't make it die or go away. There's nothing you can make Mario do to eliminate it. The only thing Mario can do is *manage* the ghosts.

With the ghost immobilized, you can take a breath and plan out your next moves. *Ok, I’ll jump on that platform; hit that question mark box; run and duck under that flame, then turn around again and recoup. Ready?... \*exhale\*… ok go...*

In the same way, you can only *manage* Resistance. And this can only be done by facing it. By bringing it into your awareness, like it’s an outside *thing* happening that you can curiously observe.

*Hmm… there he is again… ah yessss… Resistance…what a dick.*

Now, mindfully ‘facing’ the Resistance, doesn’t make it go away. With the Resistance immobilized, you can plan out your next move, just as you would Mario. *Ok… I feel the resistance. I feel the overwhelm at how much work is involved with this project. It is what it is. Ok fine… now, first move: go through my notes and extract the first argument. Then, convert it into a paragraph, then, ok, I’ll pause and recoup. Ready?... \*exhale\*… ok go...*

Then, just as you would playing Mario, with a super focused mental space (i.e. mindful and present to the moment), diligently, carefully, slowly, perform the first task (or set of tasks). If/when you feel the ghost of Resistance creeping back; again, stop. Look at it. Observe it. Take a few breathes, then plan your next moves. Then go forward some more.

String together enough of these ‘stop, observe, plan, go’ sequences and you’ll get through the work session unscathed. It might not be the quickest possible way to get things done—*the quickest way to finish a haunted house level is to ignore the ghosts and sprint through non-stop*—but it’s the surest way. For me, it’s been the only sustainable way to ramp up and maintain a solid and consistent work habit.

So that’s it. Best of luck to you in your noble quest to get disciplined in this upcoming year. And don’t forget... if you slip a bit and get nicked by the damn ghost again… don’t chuck the controller at your little brother… be kind to yourself and just use an extra life to start again… You got this!

lktxp7,"**How procrastination is triggered**: you have to do a *stressful* task. The task is stressful due to a combination of 2 components: performance and time pressure (deadline).

**How you react**: you can either **fight** the source of stress, **flee it**, or **freeze**.

# How each reaction looks like:

* **Flight:** put off the task for as long as possible, until the stress becomes unbearable (deadline approaching), and you're forced to either *fight* or *freeze*.
* **Fight:** tackle the task head on, even with aggressiveness - the typical type A stereotype. When your mindset shifts to fight mode, completing the task becomes very motivating.
* **Freeze:** bury your head figuratively in the sand. You let the deadline pass without doing anything about it, and accept your fate (given another chance, failing, getting fired). In nature, this is the animal playing dead, and letting the predator decide whether it lives or not.

# Common simple scenarios

* **Flight, followed by**
   * **Fight**: putting off tasks until the last minute, then you get a sudden boost of motivation and get it done really quickly. The very common ""I work well under pressure"" kind of procrastination.
   * **Freeze**: putting off tasks until the last minute, then realizing there's no point in putting in any more effort since there's no more time left to do a good job. This is usually a learned behaviour. After too many flight -> fights, eventually the last minute job isn't good enough, and maybe you failed, so now you don't even put up a fight anymore.
* **Fight:** As soon as the stressor (task) comes, sustain fight mode until completion of the task, and it just ends there. Taking breaks isn't ""flight"", it's like taking a rest between boxing rounds; this is important, because fighting takes a lot of energy and it's not sustainable without respite. This is what a lot of us aspire to be.
* **Freeze:** often associated with depression. The person just doesn't try anymore. Ignore bills, ignore e-mails, messages, ignore all the threats.

# How to handle multiple important tasks

* Imagine you're in a fight against multiple opponents.
   * If you have the ability to extend deadlines without consequences, do it. It's easier to fight one-on-one. Extend the deadlines to help you focus on the current fight, but don't abuse it. Once you're done with your current fight, chase down your next opponent or else they'll gang up and eventually corner you.
   * Delegate if possible. If you got friends in your fight, use them wisely.
   * Prioritize the deadliest opponents. If one of your opponents has a gun, you better take them out quickly. This is an analogy to tasks with the highest pressure consequences (final exams, big projects at work, ...)
   * Always fight one-on-one. Focus on what's in front of you, one task at a time. Forget about the other tasks while you're already working on one. Writing what needs to be done in a list helps with that - it gives your brain the permission to temporarily forget about all the other things that need to be done.

# Final thoughts

If you didn't read a single thing. Just remember to keep fighting. If you see yourself running (procrastinating) or freezing, stop running, stop freezing, fight even if you have no chance, fight until death. Once you've defeated all the opponents coming to get you, become a predator yourself. Seek out tasks to fight. In real life, this translates into taking initiative.

**Tangential cultural references**

In many Asian cultures, the word of encouragement is actually ""fight fight fight"". In English, we use ""good luck"", implying that success comes from waiting around for good fortune. I wonder if Asians' work ethic is due to this cultural difference of fighting for what you want.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

d27kzr,"**Why we procrastinate**

When faced with a decision to make or a task to complete, we usually rely on our self-control in order to push ourself to get things done. Furthermore, our motivation, which is based on the expectation of receiving some reward for our efforts, can support our self-control, and make it more likely that we will get things done in a timely manner.

However, there are also various demotivating factors that we can experience, which have an opposite effect than our motivation, meaning that they make us more likely to procrastinate. For example, anxiety and fear of failure can cause us to delay unnecessarily, as can being given a task which is unpleasant.

Furthermore, there are some hindering factors that interfere with our self-control and motivation, in a way that also makes us more susceptible to procrastination. For example, mental exhaustion, which occurs as a result of having to work hard all day, can make it more difficult for us to exert self-control if it’s already late at night. Similarly, a large gap between the time when we complete a task and the time at which we will receive the reward for completing it can cause us to discount the value of this reward, which means that its motivational value will be greatly reduced.

As long as our self-control and motivation outweigh the effects of negative factors, despite the hindering factors which interfere with them, we manage to get our work done in a timely manner. However, when the negative factors outweigh our self-control and motivation, we end up procrastinating, by putting off our work either indefinitely, or until some future point in time when the balance shifts in our favor.

**Common factors that lead to procrastination**

* Abstract goals.
* A disconnect from our future-self.
* Feeling overwhelmed.
* Anxiety.
* Task aversion.
* Fear of failure.
* Lack of motivation.
* Sensation seeking.

**Why this matters*

To successfully deal with your procrastination, you need to first figure out why you procrastinate and how your procrastination is preventing you from achieving your goals. This will allow you to formulate a concrete plan of action, based on appropriate anti-procrastination techniques, that will help you deal with your specific reasons for procrastination.

**Closing words**

The *TL;DR* is this: we procrastinate because our self-control and motivation, which might be hindered by factors such as lack of energy or delay between the present and the time when we expect to be rewarded for our efforts, are outweighed by negative factors, such as anxiety or exhaustion. This is important, because you need to understand why you procrastinate if you want to figure out how to successfully overcome your procrastination.

bl47mh,"Over the course of the past couple of years in self-development, I've come down the these conclusions:

1. You are an outsider before you are an insider
2. Everything is hard before it is easy
3. There is an acclimation time before hard becomes easy
4. Once hard becomes easy, it will be something you ""do""
5. Something you ""do"" becomes who you ""are"" over time.
6. Who you ""are"" is changeable moment by moment.

Everything you want to do in life comes down to skills, which are essentially habits, which make up your self-image.

You don't start out as a ""guitarist"" or a ""songwriter"" or an ""artist"" or a ""coder"". These are things you become over time through repetitions.

You start out knowing nothing about the guitar. Your first chord fingerings are very flimsy and your strumming is weak. Over time, when you push past this period of ignorance, you start to become familiar with the instrument. Even further, the guitar eventually becomes an extension of yourself.

Anything you want to do, be, or have in life comes down to repetitions for the most part, which leads to skills.

Want a girlfriend? Talk to more girls. Do more repetitions.

Want a job? Apply to more jobs. Do more repetitions.

Want to sing better? Practice singing every day. Do more repetitions.

Want to get more muscular? Lift more weight over time. Do more repetitions.

You have an identity shift from someone who ""wasn't good with women"" to someone who can easily get a girlfriend whenever he chooses. You have an identity shift from someone who could ""play guitar sorta"" to a ""guitarist"". You have an identity shift from ""someone who writes on the side"" to a ""writer"". That's who you are. And that's very powerful.

But it's not just about doing any old reps, it's about doing the right reps in the right way that lead to a result.

There's a way to play the guitar so you produce beautiful music. There's a way to talk to the opposite sex to produce a spark of attraction. There's a way to apply to a job that will get your application seen. There's a way to do things that produce a good result. These are the rules. Your repetitions need to line up with the ""rules of the game"" to produce a favorable result.

Football without rules isn't football anymore, it's a free-for-all. English without grammar isn't English anymore, it's gibberish. Music without rules isn't music anymore, it's just noise.

You need to make sure you develop the fundamental skills in the game that you're playing. Once you get to a high level of proficiency, then you can color outside the lines a bit. And it comes down to repetitions.

Set limits. Set a timer. Spend one hour reading the news, then set it aside. Turn the TV off. 

Talk to people—really talk, in person, on the phone, or on a video call, not here or on other social media.

Stay focused on the helpful habits and discipline that you're working to build.

It's useful to be informed about current events. That doesn't require being consumed or obsessed with them.",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] There's a lot going on in the world today. Remember that you can be informed about current events without being consumed by them.,1910,0.98
1g12rvc,"I notice a lot of posts asking advice to start new habits or drop compulsive behaviors, and they all seem to be coming from people in distress.

Although I really sympathize with the situation and would love to give comfort during such hard times, starting new habits requires a structure to do so.

The biggest reason relies on a neurological principle: Executive Function (EF).

Executive Functions works by moderating neural activity and specially emotional reactivity. They are acquired abilities during childhood, which means it's actually a congnitive effort to modulate behavior and fit into social standards.

EFs is how we are able to face problems and decompose in smaller items, how to stop or moderate harmful behaviors, how to think in long-term, how to not overreact and keep our shit together.

Stressors in our life will decrease executive functioning, and so genetic conditions.

And guess what is discipline, or the act to convince ourselves to do something without motivation? That's right. A TON of EFs.

So, before reaching to any miraculous method or tool, it's important to assess how stressors are affecting our lives in the first place, because pretty much they are the reasons you don't feel like being able to do things without motivation.

Going to the gym for example is a quite easy task, but if you suffer from low self esteem and social phobias, it will require a lot more from your EFs to overcome unregulated emotions and task initiation.

Working on different projects will require an immense pressure over EFs as it essentially will use all of them. So if you are a gym rat, it doesn't mean you will also be able to write a novel while developing an app in +8h per day. Without proper stress management, it's perfectly possible to be disciplined in some subjects and undisciplined in others.

Not to mention other conditions which will certainly affect EFs, such as ADHD, ASD and OCD.

Not being disciplined is not the end of the world, and you shouldn't feel ashamed nor feel like a failing for not being able to do a few things. Sometimes is just the way our body and mind is asking for help.

Removal of stressors, and most importantly, being gentle to yourself and accept processes with proper time will make the control much easier, and sometimes there are things that simply won't work as we expect, and that's ok.

To get disciplined, structure is required, and they are unique to each individual. This is not done by inflicting pain, but by understanding and strategy.",r/getdisciplined,"Sorry to inform, but you can’t get disciplined just by sheer will.",1912,0.97
8l98h1,"I am one of  the people that have trouble waking immidiately when my alarm clock sets  off but I have found a way that I can wake up efficiently and with no  trouble. This is by no means a scientific approach, it is just a  personal trick I have found to work on me and believe it might also have  some scientific basis. My approach is that if you have trouble waking  up, it probably is because your brain needs oxygen to wake up and some  people for one reason or the other, don't get enough oxygen in their  sleep. This is why I believe I find it more difficult to wake up when I  am in a closed room with no air flow.

So  what I do to wake up is simple.  When I wake up i don't try to force my  self to get up because it can feel pretty crappy for quite a while  afterwards. I have noticed that most of the time I wake up, I tend to  breath slower than usual. So i just sit in my bed and start elevating my  breathing rythm. I take deep breaths and I try to do it a little and a  little faster. That tends to wake me up and when I am at the point that I  breath normally I am quite woke and I can get out of bed quite easily  without feeling like crap. Try it and who knows, it might help you too",r/getdisciplined,"[Method] People that have trouble getting out of bed and end up snoozing, here's some advice",1909,0.97
k7xlwi,"Its wonderful that people are trying to get disciplined. However I'm not impressed that someone can wake up at 6am, read a chapter of fiction, a chapter of nonfiction, meditate, and workout for only one day. There is nothing in these posts regarding discipline whatsoever, just motivation, which is the antithesis of why this subreddit was started in the first place.

Now if they did this for 14 days I'd be interested in hearing the struggles they encountered and how they overcame those struggles. I'm just seeing far to many posts getting a lot of upvotes for having ambition not discipline.

I believe this should be a rule going forward. Not only because these posts are just motivation under the guise of discipline but because these posts are most likely harming the OP.  When they are getting over a hundred upvotes on day 1 of there 167 day plan they're getting rewarded for not really doing anything and that can cause them to give up sooner then they normally would when they don't get rewarded in the same way on day 12, 19, 26, etc.

Don’t ask for my credentials or backstory… I’m not a down-and-out drug addict turned-janitor-turned-professional-turned-CEO-turned motivational speaker, I’m just a 24yo dude who’s striving for self-improvement, and decided to type up some guidelines which I believe would help one lead a fulfilling life. A lot of it is regurgitation of self-help lit I’ve read, and a lot of it is admittedly platitude, but I figured that if nothing else, it would help reinforce these positive mindsets;

**10 key mindset principles/strategies to embrace;**

**1) Love yourself.** You deserve the best. You should strive for your potential - the most fulfilled version of yourself - and that potential is virtually limitless. This is the single most important mindset to adopt, as it serves as a foundation for literally everything else. It’s not a case of arrogance or entitlement, but in the sense that you would want the best for a family member of SO that you deeply love. A lot of people self-sabotage (often inadvertently), and complain that they can’t break free of negative habits… I believe this is largely due to the fact that deep down they’ve built up so much self-hatred that they don’t even feel worthy of attaining their goals and living their most fulfilling life. Fuck that. I don’t care what your backstory is, you are worthy. I am. We all are. You wouldn’t be reading this if you didn’t believe you were.

**2)** **Understand that you are the architect of your fate.** A lot of people adopt a fatalistic mindset as a coping mechanism, but instead believe that you can achieve anything you set your mind to, and let go of limiting beliefs. Sounds like some bombastic BS you were told in primary school before reality hit you like a ton of bricks right? I thought so too since I’m a rational minded guy, but then I realized there’s literally no sense in not believing that. Yeah you’ll probably never win Mr Olympia, you’ll probably never be a billionaire, you’ll probably never be entirely content with the choices you’ve made  – but that shouldn’t stop you from trying to attain your aspirations and realize your ~~dreams~~ potential. Dreams are passive not proactive. No matter how disastrous your position may seem, I can guarantee that people in worse positions have gone on to achieve their goals through the adoption of principles not unlike these. Use that as inspiration.

Also remember that no matter how ‘unfair’ life has been to you; whether you were born crippled, had to bury your child, were wrongly imprisoned for 20 years – you are the only one who can help yourself now, so long as there’s a will, which ties back to the first principle. When life gives you lemons, you can either squeeze them in your eyes, or make lemonade…you can’t change the hand you’ve been given, but you decide how to play it. You’re not responsible for all the things that befall you, but you’re entirely responsible for how you deal with them, which in turn will determine future events. So in this sense, whilst a few pages will be torn, you can write your future. This notion should be empowering, not daunting.

Be mindful that whilst learning from the past, and planning for the future you should still very much be living in the present. Don't just dwell in the past and dream of the future; If your life were a film, that would be tantamount to you whipping out your phone half-way through and re-watching the intro scene on YouTube, or conversely, browsing Reddit during a slower paced character development section whilst you wait for a cool scene. It's a rather shit way to watch a movie. There are valid reasons why one may attempt to avoid the present - pain, grief, anticipation, yearning and so on - but these headspaces are like quicksand in that the longer you allow yourself to wallow in them the deeper you'll sink, and the harder it will become to return to the present. Completely dysfunctional PTSD afflicted war veterans have gone on to recover and lead healthy lives, so it's entirely possible.

'Neuroplasticity' is an incontrovertible phenomenon...you're always capable of changing your brain for the better.

**3)** **Never stop growing.** Never rest on your laurels. Be proud of past accomplishments, but understand that you’re forever a work in progress, and always be eager to continue refining yourself. Don’t allow your static achievements to define you; “I won a national bodybuilding competition”, “I got the highest grade in my cohort”, “I earn the most out of my peer group”… they’re not solid foundations for self-worth. Instead, be proud of the fortitude, dedication, creativity etc you possess, which manifested in such achievements. Circumstances can change as the wind blows, but mental faculties you’ve developed will remain a core part of your character. Learn from constructive criticism, but dismiss other forms.

**4)** **Don’t let a molehill develop into a mountain** – pull the bandaid off quickly. When you procrastinate, the thing you’re avoiding doesn’t disappear, it just amplifies until it’s almost (mentally) insurmountable. Time spent procrastinating is never remotely enjoyable. You always have that sword looming over your head everywhere you go, everything you do. Train yourself to get used to acting as early as possible and getting it over with – then enjoying the satisfaction of doing so.

Hearken the Nike slogan and…just do it. Beginning is always the greatest hurdle. If you’re a master procrastinator you’ll need to pull in the opposite direction and essentially turn your mind off and just start the task at hand. Literally, pretend you’re a non-sentient creature devoid of higher thought for the 30 seconds it takes to open up your Assignment document and type your name, or 5 minutes that it takes to drive to the gym, or 5 seconds that it takes to approach the cute girl who smiled at you earlier. Just go through the motions. You’ll be amazed at how well you handle the next steps, and it’ll become slightly easier every time.

Another good rule of thumb; If something can be done in 5 minutes or less, and you aren’t driving on the freeway or holding a newborn baby, drop what you’re doing and get it done immediately.

I've mentally imprinted the phrase ""A year from now, you'll wish you had started today"" and I refer to that every now and then when I sense myself stalling off a new task.

Be aware of any perfectionist streak you may have, and try to keep it in check. The law of diminishing returns applies to most facets of life. Some degree of perfectionism can be leveraged as a virtue, but the maladaptive form will lead to 'analysis paralysis', inefficiency, and ironically a poor outcome - because at this level the context is irrelevant, and it's simply a manifestation of insecurity. If you must channel your perfectionism into something, let it be an artistic hobby or something of personal nature, and learn when to let go in other time-sensitive areas.

**5) Understand that life isn’t supposed to be easy**…and it would be boring if it were. There’s a quote painted on the wall of my gym “nothing worth achieving was ever achieved without effort."" I used to roll my eyes, but now I realize how incredibly accurate it is.

Imaging yourself having infinite wealth… once you’ve got the holidaying, partying, debauchery and materialistic spending sprees out of your system…unless you’ve cultivated some form of passion or cause you can devote yourself to, imagine how fucking unfulfilling and apathetic that lifestyle would be. Everything would lose its value, including relationships, and you’d struggle to find the motivation to do almost anything.

Learn to enjoy the grind itself, not merely the outcome…the journey not the destination. That’s the essence of life.

Naturally, without the negative spectrum of emotions and experiences, the positive ones wouldn't exist either. Without adversity there would be no triumph. No matter how mentally resilient you become, you'll always encounter fear...but in reality true courage isn't a lack of fear, it's acting in spite of it. I'm sure Ned Stark would agree.

**6)** **Galvanize yourself into taking positive action.** Your conscience/intuition/better judgement, whatever you want to call it, generally knows what’s best for you and what it takes to get there, but is often overpowered by the pessimist in us. Here are two techniques you can use to confront that pessimistic voice;

1 **Retroactive self-reflection**. Here’s a confronting visualization activity to motivate you into taking action; When faced with a daunting decision or challenge (one that you want to take but are hampered by your negative thoughts), envision yourself as an old folk – Zimmer frame, toothless, baby food, incontinent, lonely, family only drop in once a month if you’re lucky – and you’re propped in front of the TV, but you’re not watching daytime talk shows, rather you’re viewing a montage of all the opportunities you’ve passed up in your younger life, and you’re writhing with regret because you’ll never know what could have been. Attach this scenario to a word or phrase you can mutter so you’re not actually trying to imagine an old man shitting himself when you’re at a critical moment. Remember two adages; If you try you risk failure, if you back out you assure it; rejection stings for a minute (perhaps even a month), but regret will haunt you for a lifetime.

2 **Explicitly stating negative behaviors before or whilst you’re engaging in them**. For instance “I’m going to procrastinate on reddit for the rest of the evening,  then panic tomorrow afternoon when I realize the assignment Is due in a few hours and I haven't even started”, “I’m going to allow a spiteful comment to ruin my entire day because my self-worth is completely dependent on what a stranger thinks of me” “I’m now going to go masturbate to some unrealistic BS for 40 seconds of mild pleasure then feel utterly awful afterwards, and ruin one of my socks in the process” . Make sure to articulate it in a silly voice so it highlights how ridiculous that line of thinking is, and separates it from the self that wants to improve i.e. the true self. If you're anything like me, you'll actually struggle to even get the full thing out before you're launching a counterattack.

**7) Interrupt negative thoughts with positive ones.** Just as the former pervade your mind whenever you consider a possibility or opportunity, you can give them a taste of their own medicine by interrupting them with optimism. For instance fellas; you see a gorgeous, friendly looking girl browsing a few meters away at the supermarket, you make eye contact and she briefly smiles at you…your immediate response is actually to approach her…but that thought is swiftly interrupted by “What if she thinks I’m creepy? What if this complete stranger laughs at my face? What if I shit my pants and vomit on her?” The solution; interrupt those pessimistic thoughts instantaneously with “or what if we have incredibly chemistry, we’re exactly what the other one has been searching for, and we fall into a passionate romance that develops into a lifelong partnership?” or “so what if that happens? If she thinks I’m creepy I’ll know I need to work on how I project myself. If she laughs at me I will have dodged a bullet. If I shit myself and vomit I’ll become more resilient for it as I will have survived the worst case scenario.” So put yourself outside your comfort zone, and into situations where you’ll have the opportunity to silence that naysaying motherfucker...then to really spite it, take action.

Of course, in situations where there is a substantial degree of risk, you must make the distinction between baseless pessimistic thoughts (which should be overridden) versus the conscience speaking from experience (which should be heeded within reason).

**8)** **Positively reframe situations.** Similar to the previous point, but more generalized. Instead of looking at the gym as a place of sweat and pain, look at it as a place for strengthening the body and mind. Instead of looking at a job interview as a torturous exercise in awkward silences,  humble bragging, and sycophantism, look at is as an opportunity to improve the way you project yourself, fortify mental resilience, and potentially enter a fulfilling career. Instead of telling yourself ‘I can’t do this’ or ‘I’m terrible at this’ include the addendum ‘yet’ and ‘but, I can learn’.  Learn to enjoy challenges as they become opportunities for either success or learning. Look at failures as chances for error correction and personal growth. Learn to deal with setbacks and failures constructively, without giving up and reverting back to detrimental habits. Don’t expect yourself to fail, but don’t lambaste yourself if you do – treat it all as a learning exercise. Many are scared to try their absolute hardest in the fear that they may still ‘fail’ – however the silver lining in this situation is that you’ve now experienced the worst case scenario and lived to tell the tale, thus you become more resilient to future failures, and are able to focus on identifying causes rather than the act itself.  After all, humanity has progressed on the back of countless failures, but wouldn’t have if they were never capitalized as learning opportunities.

**9)** **Any progress is good progress**. Rome wasn’t built in a day. You can’t edit a blank page. Don’t expect to go from a lazy, unstructured layabout to Mr Efficiency overnight, over a week, over a month, even over a year – this is placing (often deliberately) unrealistic expectations on yourself and setting yourself up for disappointment. Deeply ingrained negative thought loops and harmful habits take time to overcome and redirect into positive ones. Our brains are adaptable and It will happen eventually, but it’s done incrementally, and it takes time, consistency and resolve. Divide large tasks into manageable chunks; a series of sprints rather than trying to run the marathon. Everyone runs their own race at their own pace – don’t exclusively compare your progress to that of somebody else, no matter how similar you believe yourselves to be. The only person you should truly compare yourself to is your younger self. Another crucial axiom to remember when pursuing long-term goals is ""Never give up on a ~~dream~~ goal because of the time it will take to accomplish. The time will pass anyway.""

Caveat: Comparing oneself to others is natural, and you'll be judged in relation to others throughout life in a social and professional context - however when determining personal progress, your best yardstick is yourself.

 

**10)** **Keep yourself accountable.** Note the tasks you wish to achieve that day in a journal of some sort, and reflect on your completion of them at the end. Commend yourself for achievements, but don’t chastise yourself over those you didn’t. This is crucial in building self-efficacy, and eventually it will become habitual. Try to minimize the concessions you give yourself;  “Today is gonna be a lazy day, I’ll get back on top of things tomorrow” but don’t allow a slip up to completely ruin any momentum and progress you’ve made. You’re only human, and even the most productive people have ‘lazy days’  – plus self-disgust isn’t a sustainable motivator to improve.  Nonetheless, endeavor to remain mindful of what you’re doing as often as possible, and gently guide yourself back on track if you’ve become derailed. At the other end of the spectrum, thrive on the liberating moments where you've managed to turn off autopilot and take the reins of your own life - use this to drive further constructive behavior.

**Life guidance:**

&#x200B;

**Physiological;**

\- Ensure you get sufficient sleep (at least 6 hours), during roughly the same time windows each night. Emphasis on night because daytime sleep isn’t as rejuvenating. Don’t lay in bed in the morning, get up immediately. Circadian rhythm has an enormous impact on mood, and metabolism, so optimize it.

\- Have cold showers to build self-efficacy In a tangible way (start with them warm but finish with them cold if you prefer)

\- Stop any intensely stimulating activity and go screen free for at least half an hour before attempting to sleep, as blue light suppresses melanin production.

\- Exercise routinely and consistently. Increased energy levels, increased virility, improved self-esteem, and mood elevation are well known corollaries. It’s also a microcosm for seeing the direct and tangible results of hard work. Go for a mix of weightlifting and cardio but tailor them to your specific goals. Remember to stretch, do any preventative and rehabilitative exercises if required - remember the golden rule; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As with most things extremity isn't healthy either - steroid use, deliberately dehydrating, extreme distance running, competitive powerlifting etc, but that's your prerogative.

\- Ensure you aren’t sedentary for hours on end.  Aim to get up and walk around at least once every hour.

\- Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Calculate your calorie requirements and try counting calorie intake a few times roughly understand how it translates to food. Food is your body's fuel source, and it's incredible how many people put more thought into filling up their vehicle than their own body. Try to spread meals throughout the day for ongoing energy, and limit the amount you eat during nocturnal hours. Stay hydrated.

\- Do what you can to improve your physical appearance and presentation within reason; take care of your hair and skin, ensure good dental hygiene, use antiperspirants and deodorant to eliminate BO... but don’t obsess over appearance/become conceited.

\- Without being neurotic, take any preventative measures you can to maintain optimal constitution; wear sunscreen, use eye protection, work ergonomically, floss etc.

\- If you wish to express your creative/counter-cultural/rebellious/zany side through your appearance, go right ahead, but remember that unfortunately there are still many who will form preconceptions based on your appearance (yes that’s a fault on their part…but still something you'll have to deal with).

\- Don’t overly stress about aches and pains, but have routine check-ups, and visit sooner rather than later if you believe something is amiss with your health.

\- Try not to put yourself in overly risky situations. It's natural to seek adrenaline, but take a minute to weigh up the risks before doing something which your better judgement is advising against.

\- Remember you only get one body (and mind), so take bloody good care of it.

&#x200B;

**Social and Relationships;**

\- Socialize as much as possible (even if you have to force yourself sometimes). If you don’t enjoy socializing with your current friends, try to find those with whom you do. Humans are social creatures, and long-term solitude takes a heavy toll on one’s mental state.

\- Money, status, appearance…nothing can buy authentic positive relationships. Never take them for granted. They’re perhaps the truest indicator of a ‘successful’ life. Love, friendship, and respect aren’t unconditional. If they were, they would be meaningless. Take an interest in other peoples lives. And no matter how frustrated you are, never leave a partner, family member, or friend on a bad note.

\- Aim to give your family the best side of yourself. Unfortunately we seem to have an almost natural instinct to displace frustration and anger built up from work and daily life onto family members, because we can ostensibly get away with it. People can be tolerant and forgiving towards their loved ones, but they're not stress balls with 10 minute memories. Make a conscious effort to be good to them no matter how shit you're feeling, because they deserve that treatment, and so do you.

\- Help others. Again, we’re social creatures and the act of helping others in need delivers tremendous boosts to self-worth (In this sense I think altruism is a paradox but that another topic).

\- Mood is contagious. Try to surround yourself with positive people who inspire you and encourage you to chase your potential.

\- Try to help troubled friends/family in whatever ways you can, but know where to draw the line, at which point their wellbeing is out of your hands, and worrying is only going to pain you.

\- Avoid or cut out unequivocally toxic people. I don’t believe anyone is evil, or beyond redemption, but minimize your exposure to those who only bring you down.

\- Try to find a partner who is essentially a best friend...albeit with benefits. Romance will eventually fade, and you want to ensure that you’re left with somebody you can spend your life with who’s personality is a good compliment to yours.

\- Remember when you allow somebody to build you up, you give them the power to break you down. Allow yourself to become infatuated with someone, but don’t allow your self-worth to hinge on their feelings toward you. Never make someone a priority if they only make you an option. Desperation and neediness are two of the most unattractive qualities somebody can exhibit.

\- If you can feel yourself losing your temper, briefly envisage that somebody you deeply respect, or somebody who looks up to you as a role model is present and think twice. Anger never wins arguments either. Also ask yourself if the frustration will still exist a week from now...chances are the answer is no.

\- Little acts of kindness/thoughtfulness such as genuine compliments (not effusively) go a long way and can truly make somebody’s day. If more people adhered to this the world would be a slightly more pleasant place. People don't often remember what you do or say, but they remember how you make them feel - so even if the act is seemingly insignificant, it will be remembered in a positive light.

\- In a relationship; lay solid foundations early on and don't expect issues to simply resolve themselves later down the line, communication and trust are the two cornerstones, be ok with spending time apart and maintaining your own lives, reframe arguments as 'us' versus 'the problem', don't sacrifice personal passions, remember that emotions are irrational and can't be analyzed only accepted, they're a two-way street which require equivalent effort from both parties to function whatsoever let alone healthily.

&#x200B;

**Career;**

&#x200B;

\- Try to work within a career you find fulfilling, but understand that the notion of ‘doing what you love’ is specious, and in some cases can actually ruin the passion if you associate it too closely with mundane work. You can still find your work fulfilling without having a ‘passion’ for it, such as when you feel you’re having a positive impact, being adequately recognized, or have achieved mastery in a given area.

\- Don't be afraid to leverage Nepotism. There's nothing dishonorable or condemnatory about it. Perhaps there was once, but these days it's basically the norm. So the CEO's wife's sisters hairdressers less qualified son got the job instead of you - people like doing personal favors. Don't hate the players or the game, learn to use that to your advantage. Expand your network, and do favors for others so they can reciprocate. Who you know gets you the job then what you know keeps you in it.

\- In an interview; Ensure you arrive a few minutes early so you're not additionally stressed. Bring a copy of your resume. Prepare sufficiently - no matter how much you hate the idea of pre-rehearsed responses, no matter how skilled at speaking extemporaneously you may be, it's still worth anticipating questions and planning answers. Research the company and industry. Maintain good body language and eye contact. Don't criticize past employers (find a more constructive way to discuss difficulties). Show a glimpse of your personality/humor but be reserved/formal. Don't be afraid to pause and think before answering (something that society needs to do more in general). Ask them questions; ""what are a few words you would use to describe the culture of the company?"" ""What do you personally enjoy most about working here?"" ""Let's say I've been selected for the role - what measures will be used to gauge my performance?"" Remember it's a two-way process - you're also trying to determine whether it's a place that you want to spend most of your waking life (granted you can't always afford to be very picky).

\- In a workplace;  Be friendly, authentic and don't hide your personality but maintain a degree professionalism (especially at after work drinks etc). avoid very controversial discussions, politics and drama wherever possible even if you secretly thrive on that. don't shit where you eat so to speak. Keep a low(ish) profile and work particularly hard initially to make a good first impression. Make yourself less expendable by putting yourself in linchpin positions with projects and tasks wherever possible. do (reasonable) favors for coworkers. Try to ensure that others can clearly see the results of your work/effort. Don't be afraid to (tactfully) assert your opinion to your superiors or anybody if you believe it's worth hearing - they won't see it as some act of insubordination, and they'll probably respect you for it.

&#x200B;

**Misc Lifestyle;**

\- Do not even consider having a child until you and your partner are ready to dedicate your lives to raising them as healthily as possible. If you’re not in a position to adequately provide for them (financially or emotionally), or you have personal aspirations that will be difficult to achieve as a parent, you’re not ready. This is the one thing in your life that you can't half-ass, and there’s really no margin for error here.

\- Finance wise, create a separate savings account in which a portion of your income is automatically deposited (or do so manually) - one that gains the maximum interest offered and which you don't touch unless times are tough. Only withdraw from it when faced with a crisis or when carrying out a significant well-thought out purchase, otherwise treat it as though it doesn't exist. Don't get caught up in the paper chase and hoard copious amounts of money - ensure your family is well off and has future financial security for peace of mind, but don't become parsimonious. Money spent creating happy memories (or attempting to) is never wasted. Invest in passions and hobbies within reason, donate to virtuous causes, travel and see as much of the world as you can. Never judge somebody purely by their wealth; given that it's not everybody's goal and there are so many other factors, it shouldn't be used as a universal metric for success.

\- Always find time to indulge in passions or interests, as they have a significantly positive impact on one’s mood and outlook. My primary passion is music, and It's honestly been a lifeline for me.

\- Cut out porn. forever. It’s not just desensitizing you sexually and creating unrealistic expectations, but the dopamine rush associated with it mimics drug use, and is insidious in the long run. Sublimate those urges into productive tasks or behaviors that will help you attain the real thing. It’s hard, but worth it. Also put time boundaries on general internet usage.

\- Learn how to cook. Save money, build self-sufficiency, conducive to being healthy, and it's a very attractive trait.

\- Try to be punctual and stick to your word. Reliability is one of the most vital attributes in both a social and professional context. Unreliability is often interpreted as a lack of respect for the other parties in the social setting, and a lack of regard for one's work in the professional setting.

\- Read. Ideally edifying content, but not purely self-help literature - anything that engages you - fiction or not fiction. Besides from being enjoyable, it delivers a plethora of benefits. Alternatively, listen to audio books or podcasts.

\- Ideally, don’t do drugs, don’t smoke, and keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. I’m far from a prude, and I’ve done my share of substances, but they really can precipitate a downward spiral, particularly in people more susceptible to addiction and mental disorders. Life is challenging enough without them.  Prove to yourself that you don't need to rely on them as a social crutch, or as a temporary escape from reality, because that becomes self-perpetuating.

\- Be ambitious; try new things, visit new places, speak to strangers – you never know where they may lead, and what hidden passions may be uncovered by doing so. Remember that friends are just strangers you haven't met yet. So are enemies, but that doesn't help my point.

\- Say yes to (m)any offers/opportunities besides those in which your conscience/intuition/gut is firmly telling you not to - socially, professionally, romantically, etc. This isn't a 2008 comedy Starring Jim Carey, so don't feel guilty for saying 'no', but challenge yourself to take up auspicious offers you would usually refuse.

\- Keep up to date with current events and friends lives, but be wary of the pernicious effects of the news and social media. The former is sensationalized and catastrophized for mass appeal (vicariously), and the latter presents a very distorted portrait of peoples lives (aka their highlights) which can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Try to detach from sources that exacerbate your insecurity (social influencers), and follow sources that inspire creativity and zeal (artists).

\- Try to minimize the amount of lies (even white lies) you tell. Others may never know the truth, but you have to carry the guilt around, and it begins to erode your self-concept.

\- Use a diary, calendar, or some form of system to manage your time as effectively as possible. It’s incredible how much time seems to materialise out of thin air once you’re using it more efficiently. Life is short. Time flies by just as fast when you’re moping around in apathy...the difference is you aren’t getting anything accomplished and consequently feeling guilty for it.

\- Find 10 minutes to do something meditative each day. It doesn’t need to be meditation per se, but anything that allows you to reach a state of tranquility and block out the noise of daily life – known to reduce stress and help build self-awareness. Eventually you’ll be able to enter this state with greater ease, and it can be a useful tool to use when required.

\- Play a sport/join a club. Ideally something that you're interested in, but really anything to keep you active, socializing, and expanding your friend network. Social leagues are a good idea, because they're not so competitive that there's stress involved, but they tick the other boxes.

\- Even if you despise politics, take a small time to research the policies and recent history of the political parties you'll be deciding between,  so you can have a somewhat informed vote. Consider whether they're designed to be immediately appealing or beneficial in the longer-term. Political parties know that most don't bother to do any research in the lead up, so try to win votes via methods such as propaganda, smear campaigns, hollow rhetoric, and fear mongering.  Even if you'rel disillusioned with the system, don't allow that to prevent you from using your vote, and if you're not fond of any of the parties still vote for the one(s) you're least not fond of (there's a simpler way to say that). If political discussion only frustrates you as it does with many, then avoid it until it comes time to vote again... short of engaging in political activism there's nothing you can do once the ballots have been counted anyway.

\- Compartmentalize your tasks and mindframes; work hard, play hard. Attempting both concurrently will leave you in limbo.

&#x200B;

**Philosophical;**

\- A meaningless existence doesn't necessitate a purposeless life - it means you get to decide what that purpose is. Life is your playground. As an atheist, I'm living under the assumption that this is it. I've never let that thought demoralize me though, rather I've always viewed it as being life-affirming. I've no idea why anything is as it is, why nature is in relentless pursuit of procreation, why we've developed the sentience to question our own existence - but these aren't questions that will ever be answered. The fact is we're here, we all have the ability to experience intrigue, wonderment, joy, pleasure, mirth, love and fulfillment to some capacity even if we don't understand why, so we might as well capitalize on this and try to maximize these in our lives and the lives of those around us.

\- If you haven’t identified any strong passions in your life, don’t despair. Continue improving yourself in every other general sense, and understand that (arguably) most people don’t have burning, innate passions – they’re often more subtly disguised and uncovered serendipitously. Either way, a lack of strong passion(s) won’t prevent you from living a rich and fulfilling life.

\- Be skeptical, never cynical. The former will help guide your decisions, the latter will just preclude opportunities. Question everything, make minimal assumptions, if a statement sounds fanciful, it likely is. Operate with the knowledge that some people will sometimes employ machiavellianism to benefit their own agenda, as we all have done to some degree, however don't resign to the belief that everybody you meet is full of deceit until proven otherwise, as that will lead to general bitterness toward society.

\- Learn how to have debates not arguments; always focus on the issue and don't resort to ad hominen attacks (even if they do) as that will weaken your stance and chance you have of persuading the other party. Remember that many peoples opinions have been deeply ingrained and reinforced throughout their life via confirmation bias, so often they'll cling to their argument even if they can see the error, to avoid embarrassment and hypocrisy. Try to enter into discussions with a (genuinely) open mind, willing to have your view changed. You never actually learn from those who agree with you, so debating is a healthy way to challenge your own beliefs.

\- Attempt to minimize knee-jerk reactions & pearl-clutching in response to taboo or contentious topics, as that's inimical to productive discourse and progression in general.

\- Practice gratitude - from family support to simplicities such as running water - as it will help with positive reframing.

\- Remember that your mind is a product of its genome (biology) and envirome (environment and experience/nurture); stereotyping/typecasting/xenophobia etc are natural heuristics inculcated throughout history as it offered a survival advantage in the days of tribalism, thus embedded in our biology. You can, and should always attempt to consciously override it, but don't be disgusted with yourself, or others for instinctively doing so. Social norms evolve faster than biology; that should never be used as an excuse, just an explanation.

\- Never prejudge anybody based on their title – purely by the integrity of their character. There are corrupt doctors who’ve beguiled their way through life, and honest vagrants who’s honor was their undoing. You be the judge. *Try* to avoid evaluating somebody’s character until you know their story; they could be trudging through the darkest hour of their life without any coping strategies, as expressed through hostility and negativity.

\- Truly dominant individuals don't need to try to make their dominance known, as they're quietly confident in themselves. In the wise words of Tywin Lannister; ""Any man who must exclaim 'I am the King' is no true king""

\- Don’t try to be something you’re not. Place yourself in settings where you feel comfortable speaking your mind;  remove yourself from those in which you don't. Adapt to the social context of course - nobody acts exactly the same around everybody so don't feel guilt - but don’t compromise core values for other peoples approval. Social acceptance is biologically instilled in us, but accept that not everybody you meet is going to like you, and if they simply like your tailored persona then they don’t truly like you. Remember the asshole equation; if somebody is rude to you, they're the asshole (or going through tough times)...if everybody is rude to you, you're the asshole.

\- Try to be less judgmental and more empathetic toward others for holding their values and opinions. Introjection and indoctrination are powerful processes. Put yourself in their shoes to determine why they do, think and say the things they do. Do the same with yourself pertaining strong opinions you hold.

\- Remember that (virtually) nobody thinks of themselves as being the bad guy in a situation. You judge yourself by your intentions and others by their actions. Everyone is entitled to fuck up, just as you are, and theoretically, why would you be any different to them if you were in their shoes? Never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance.

\- Never hold against somebody that which was out of their control. Ethnicity, heritage, gender, religion, sexual orientation ,fetishes, birth defects, the fact that their father is a convicted serial killer – everybody deserves to be born with a clean slate. It's senseless being proud or ashamed of your heritage/lineage, as you've personally had no influence over it's development, and therefore shouldn't allow it to have any effect on your self-worth... doing so would undermine the agency of the individual.

\- Live and let live – everybody has different trajectories in life. If somebody wants to get face tattoos, dedicate their life to bodybuilding, marry a member of the same sex, as long as it’s not directly effecting you, who gives a shit? If you know them closely you can voice your opinion, offer your wisdom, but so long as it's bringing them happiness and not harming others, it's their life - and you have no right to dictate how they live it.

\- Seek to find joy everyday in the small things. The big picture is frankly bleak; we’ll all have to part with the ones we love eventually, and who knows what becomes afterwards, so don’t dwell on it. Of course, that’s not to say don’t pursue long-term goals, as those are what will bring fulfillment.

\- Ultimately, don’t take life too seriously. Laugh instead of cry. Literally nothing is too serious to be joked about (besides the obvious things like metal splinters, single ply toilet paper, Uni group projects and cassowaries), but know when to laugh. Don't immediately judge others for making light of morbid situations, as it's a common coping mechanism. Be able to laugh about your own 'flaws' - but if you'd rather not, and have the ability, do something about them. Summarized by a great quote; ""take your responsibilities seriously, but not yourself.""

**P.S. Mental Illness;**

Addressing the elephant in the room; mental disorders. I deliberately avoided mentioning them, so not to invalidate the advice offered. Utilize the above advice after treating any underlying mental disorders you may be harboring.

If really struggling, consider speaking to a psychologist/therapist, as their detached yet knowledgeable perspective can be valuable. A good method for self-reflection if nothing else.

If completely devoid of hope and unable to cope, if the negative voice in your head is deafening, if you’re paralyzed by anxiety - see a psychiatrist ASAP.

Unfortunately in some cases the only way to rectify aberrant mood and thought is through psychiatric treatment...medication, CBT, ECT...it works. There’s no longer a stigma, and if somebody condemns you for seeking mental health treatment that's merely a reflection of their ignorance and insecurity.

Of course, this will only serve to get you back on your feet - then it’s the adoption of principles such as these that will have you racing toward your potential!",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] A Comprehensive guide to becoming the best version of yourself,1901,0.98

Hello, people!

I am planning to release a series of articles about dealing with perfectionism, procrastination and decision making.

I am posting now the first part and if there are people who want me to share the other parts, I will do so in the next days. Please write a comment if you want the other parts!

Thank you and here we go 

Do you recognize yourself in the following lines?

*I can’t stop thinking about a mistake I made.*

*When I have made a decision I often doubt my choice.*

*I feel inferior to people more successful than me.*

*Every thing I do has to be 100% perfect.*

*I tend to ruminate and overthink a lot.*

*I have an all-or-nothing thinking.*

You are trying to make the best decision, but you cannot decide which one is the best. You make lists over lists, you overthink for months and you end up… nowhere. After that, you’re saying to yourself that you’re going to do this no matter what, that you cannot waste your time anymore – you feel a power within yourself to change yourself for the better but when you are facing decision making and actually doing things… procrastination and frustration win the stage.

In time, things are getting worse by starting to regret the wasted time and the wasted opportunities wasted. To make the situation even worse, you start comparing yourself to others: “Why they can do more?”, “Why do they have more?” And there is an endless loop of frustration, anxiety and pain which seems you cannot get out of.

Congrats! You are a perfectionist like I was! I know your struggle and your pain and I am here to help you guide to solve some of these problems. I know what I’ve been through and I know what I am talking about.

People of Reddit, are you ready?

So.

Let’s know what a perfectionist is. The main definition of a perfectionist is a person who is judging his self-worth based on his achievements. The problem is not this – the problem is that a perfectionist has very very high unrelenting standards that no one can ever achieve. Even if someone is saying to him that what he’s done is **more than enough**, he will not believe that person. It’s awful thinking this way! A perfectionist tends to see only the things he or she did not accomplish!

In this text I am going to focus on one of the two types of perfectionists – the ones who procrastinate by waiting for the best time to start and the best opportunity to come. The other one is the one who works a lot which can ruin his emotional and physical health – their chain of thoughts is “I have to work and work all day to achieve my goal!”.

Next.

A lazy perfectionist, a procrastinator, so to say, is the one who is waiting for the best opportunity to make the best move and to get the perfect result. This is the most basic definition. Where is the problem? The problem is that he never begins due to certain reasons:

a.  Black and white thinking – “I either do it fully, or I don’t do it at all”;

b.  Catastrophising – they beat themselves up by making a tiny tiny small mistake;

c.  High standards – that **cannot** be achieved by anyone;

d.  Overthinking, rumination – think things inside out and not taking any action;

e.  Excessive list making – making plans repeatedly and not taking any action.

Being is perfectionist is, by definition, wrong from the beginning. Why? No man alive ever in his life went from A to B perfectly, without encountering obstacles, without having struggles and without having any losses. Trying to make things perfect all the time will only get you making your life worse. Things are *perfectable*, but they can never be perfect. It’s ok, it’s highly recommended to aim high, but you should have in mind that things might no go as you though of. *(or maybe this is the beauty of life :)*

Someone who procrastinates stays in a neverending loop of rumination and overthinking. **You cannot evolve while you stay**. You gotta put some action. The question is: *how?*

I am a guy who struggled with perfectionism all his life. I did not know that I had this \*issue – so to speak –\*until I started to get into psychology and self-help. In the past 4 years, I got into this domain and the more I explored it the more I discovered myself and got to know why people think the way they think and why people act the way they act.

So.

In order to solve a problem, you have to define the problem. If you do not know what you are confronting with, you will always be in the fog waving the sword to the dragons that are not there.

Like I said earlier, I am going to focus on the perfectionists who procrastinate and who had a hard time making the perfect decision.

In order to deal with this issue, we need an holistic approach. The following lines are derived from my experience of dealing with perfectionism and the books I’ve read, videos I watched and successful people I modelled. **These are guidelines, not recipes!**

**You need to be guided, you don’t need a universal recipe! Because there are no universal recipes, each one of us is** **unique!** ***<- I can’t emphasize enough this statement.***

Ok. Let’s see!

There are four main areas in your life you need to focus on, to work on. These areas are interrelated.

1. Family & friends – here is included your parents’ family, your own family with your spouse and your relationship with your friends – this segment is about social life and social circles you are present in;
2. Job & career – there is a difference – in a job you work like 8-10h/day and having a career requires that you work as much as you can;
3. Leisure time – the time you have outside work should be used properly. For most of the people their jobs are not their dream jobs. So, you need the time outside work to use it for your hobbies and activities that will charge you with positive energy;
4. Physical and mental health – it need to be maintained in order to function properly in the society, at job and in family.

I categorized *life* in these four parts to understand better how to handle the problem. If you don’t understand now, be patient, you’ll get it later from this text.

This text is about helping you making the right decision, building healthy and worthy habits and living a much more meaningful life. By following the information in the next pages you will become less stressed and less anxious, you will be more in control of your life and you will have stability in your life. You will learn that fear of failure can be just an illusion because, most of the times, failure can be the greatest thing that ever happened to you. You will no longer procrastinate over small tasks and the big one and you will feel more productive and you’ll get the sense that you are going somewhere worthwhile. You will learn how to handle your perfectionism.

Next.

Human beings need a target. We need a goal. Having no goal is very problematic. You should have a goal that is worth by your standards. And here we are facing the first problem of being a perfectionist.

You are going to find these targets/goals in the four main areas described above. Life is divided into these parts – by doing so, it is easier to orient yourself in live and to make an accurate decision.

What are my goals? Which goal is the best for me? What if I start pursuing one goal and I miss the other one? What if I will never do what I like? How do I get straight from A to B? this is how a perfectionist is thinking. Wanna tell you a secret: **almost never you’re ever going from A to B. Because it simply … can’t.**

Thank you for your time and please comment if you have any questions!

And please do not forget to tell me if you want the other parts!!!

&nbsp;

And one of the most common things I see is people struggling with developing and improving themselves because of a lack of self love.

&nbsp;

When it comes to self love, most of the advice I see being given out is in regards to the physical development. Working out, eating healthier, doing what you enjoy, mediating, etc. However, I barely see any suggestions on how to develop self love in regards to the mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the self.

&nbsp;

I'd be interested in sharing my story with developing self love, and how I was able to overcome deep rooted depression through tackling all forms of the self, and to truly learn how to love myself and overcome all my nervousness, anxiety, low self esteem, low self value, and overall negative outlook on life.

&nbsp;

I'd also like to share the practices that got me over my issues, and helped to develop myself to the person I am today.

&nbsp;

So I'm interested in knowing if anyone would like to see something like that shared here. I'd post 4 separate posts in respect to all four aspects of self love, giving detailed examples and methods to implement in order to develop each. 

&nbsp;

You guys interested?

1ey147c,"So, a lot has been going on lately in my life, and one of them is getting a new job as an international student, not to mention the research position at my university AND my regular classes AND gym AND Guitar practice. Balancing these things has become so cumbersome that some days I just want to be left alone without talking to anyone. But something miraculous happened when I started waking up at 5:30 in the morning.

At the start, it was really difficult and made me miserable. I snoozed my alarm a lot of times, which resulted in me missing my buses and trains, which had a chain reaction of me getting late for work and having some issues with my job.

Recently, I went to the bookstore and laid my eyes on the book Morning Miracle, which said that the author changed his life after getting up just half an hour earlier than usual, so copying his method, I did the same.

I got up at 5:30 sharp, and followed the following schedule:

1. 5 minutes of journaling
2. 5 minutes of drinking water, in peace
3. 5 minutes of meditation
4. 5 minutes of push-ups
5. 5 minutes of looking at vision board

I found that after following these basic habits for 21 days straight, I got my performance in my job to a new f\*\*g level—not exaggerating. When I walk down the aisle, I feel as if I have taken compound V. I can feel the air hitting my face differently, and I am more focused and have the mental stamina to go through my day and still have energy for myself, I tried to rationalize this by stating that this is the placebo effect, but no, things have been \*ACTUALLY\* different for me.

>Starting your day in the solitude best assed in the morning will help you retain the focus you need to optimize your daily tasks

A special mention I would like to give to mindfulness practice: I used to get overwhelmed easily, and my mind would do a mental throw-up after my job. I eventually had no time left for people who actually mattered to me, and my relationships would suffer. I have observed that:

>After meditating, I can take tasks one by one, instead of juggling between several ones, which significantly drains out your mental capacity. My focus remains on the thing I am currently doing and the rest fades away

The first thing you should be doing in the morning is controlling your cortisol, the fear hormone, which is a significant contributor to mental fatigue- To control this, do the following:

>Reflect on your present blessings — every man has many- State down 3 things you are grateful for and practice solitude

After you’re done with this, embrace the elephant in the room and write down the most important task you want to finish, followed by others in descending order of importance, This will help you finish the tasks which contribute to 80% of the outcome while minimizing low-priority and fulfilling tasks which could have been finished with a little mental capacity and focus

Finally, give some time to outline and work on things that can help you increase your current knowledge related to your work or life, because hey, no one is a loser when they continuously improve themselves and learn a thing or two every day. Besides, if you do get a professional online certification, there will be a sweet promotion waiting for you at the end of the current year!

1l10v5v,"Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to adapt and reorganize by forming new neural connections throughout life. This means that the brain can change its structure and function in response to repeated experiences, learning, thoughts, and behaviors.

Simply put, when we repeat an action or thought, your brain gradually creates neural connections that increasingly facilitate that behavior or thought. When we constantly repeat negative thoughts or beliefs like ""I'm insufficient, I'm a failure,"" the neural networks that sustain them strengthen, making them more automatic and difficult to change. This is the root cause of low self-esteem—they're just bad habits. Then, confirmation bias develops. That is, your brain pays special attention to behaviors that confirm your belief, ignoring other possibilities like ""I made a mistake, but that doesn't make me a failure.""

Now, what does this have to do with procrastination?  Well, every time you avoid a task, ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" your brain registers that immediate relief (escaping the discomfort).  The neural connections that link the task with ""danger"" (stress, boredom, fear of failure) are strengthened, while those linked to disciplined action weaken. In other words, the more you procrastinate, the stronger that association becomes, and the harder it is to break out of that cycle.

You have to constantly repeat REALISTIC (non-toxic) positive thoughts, even if you don't believe them at first. Over time, your brain will begin to believe them. Phrases like ""I am enough just the way I am"" or ""I'm not perfect, I'm human, and I can make mistakes"" are the first step to gradually changing your brain's neural networks.",r/getdisciplined,"When I discovered how ""neuroplasticity"" works, my life changed",1885,0.99

go24t7,"Stop saying ""just get disciplined."" Seriously.

It's completely useless. We are here because we don't know how to be disciplined. Many of us have mental issues that make it hard. ""Just get disciplined"" is about as useful as ""just stop being sad."" I've seen this ""advice"" here time and time again, and I cannot emphasize enough how destructive it is. 

When discipline is something you've always struggled with, you've probably always TRIED. You've probably always made the attempt. It's just, you've failed every time. If someone tells you to just ""do it,"" it becomes ""well I TRIED EIGHT TIMES"" and you start thinking you just CANT do it. If it's as simple as they say, why can't you do it? Why can't I do it?

Because it's not that damn simple. If it was, this sub would consist entirely of a sticky with the Nike logo and ""just do it."" People here need actual advice on how to retrain their brain to become disciplined. This can be through many techniques, including ones I HAVE seen mentioned here - CBT, focusing on health, even medication is the answer for some. But it seems whenever someone posts some advice, it's met with multiple comments about how you don't need any of that, you just need to ""get disciplined.""

e23fgy,"Remember the excitement you felt the first time you bought a gym membership? I certainly do, a long time ago.

I would get so excited that I trained until I could barely walk or even raise my arms.

But as weeks passed by I became less and less thrilled to be at the gym. I started to hate the smells and the crowdedness. I started to hate the dizziness and pain heavy lifting left me. I started to hate the utterly disgusting taste of protein shakes.

Eventually, the thoughts of going to the gym would terrify me.

The same went for everything in my life. First, I discovered something new and dove hard into it. Then, I got impatient when I didn't see the results.  Then, I got discouraged when faced with challenges. Finally, I decided it was not worth it and gave up.

Motivation can get you started - but that's all it will ever do for you. Motivation is a feeling, and **feelings don't last**. And once it runs out, you're done for.

But what's real is HABIT - the permanent neurological connections of your brains.

When you have developed a habit, it doesn't matter if you hate or love doing something, **you do it anyways**.

For example, after I FORCED myself to do intense home calisthenics for 60-days straight, I became so accustomed to it that I couldn't stop working out until now. One day I even felt horrible when I got so bed-ridden sick that I couldn't work out.

That said, my body is better than it was EVER before, the same goes for my health, strength, and overall well-being.

The power of habit is REAL - but you MUST survive the first 60 days, otherwise, you'd be quickly back to ground zero.

Yes, there will be times when you could barely muster the will to do it, there will be times when you would be screaming in agony and there will even be times you would want to slam the ""Exit"" button.

But don't worry, 60 days will be over before you know it. You'd be surprised how easy things will become. And life would only get better because you are now a much tougher creature of positive habits and lifestyles.

# How to start working after you procrastinated the whole day

*“I’ve been procrastinating the whole day.”*

*“I haven’t done anything today, I’m such a loser.”*

*“Nothing done, again. Why do I always end up watching YouTube videos?”*

All of us have experienced a day when we’re surfing the internet the whole day instead of doing something productive.

Let’s say it’s already late afternoon, **what are you going to do?**

Most of us, if there isn’t any scary deadline looming close, **say “what the hell, might as well continue”** **and waste the rest of the day.**

It’s called the **What The Hell effect**.

The best example of it is when people diet.

They eat healthy for some time, but then they slip. They eat a donut or drink soda.

“What the hell…” and then they go on binge eating streak.

This is binary thinking - 0 or 1. I was eating healthy (at 1), but then I failed by eating something unhealthy, I’m at 0 and whatever I do now doesn’t matter.

But it does matter. After the binge is over, regret and low self-esteem flood in.

And it works the same with productivity. I haven’t done anything yet, therefore I’m 0, I’m a loser. You can also hear: I don’t have enough time to do something now or I’m already tired. Might as well finish that TV series.

**Why do we let ourselves get away with doing this?**

Because **we love resets**: starting tomorrow, starting next week or starting on the New Year.

All these resets have something in common. They’re in the future and we naively think this time it’ll be different.

Can it work? Kind of. Some people can really change their lives by resetting. But simply remember how gyms are full at the beginning of January and how soon they empty out.

Also, this concept of reset has still the same glitch. **The Binary Thinking**. When you don’t go to the gym once, you failed, you’re a loser now, again.

**Because resets fail most of the time, we shouldn’t bet on them.**

What to do instead?

## Mindset Shift #1: Dump the Binary Thinking

It is possible to be at 1 or 0 but in most cases, it isn’t worth it. **We don’t have to be perfect in our diet, productivity or life in general to move forward**.

**When you eat a cookie, you aren’t at 0.**

If you count that you eat 5 times per day that makes it 35 meals per week. You failed once out of 35 tries. **That puts you at 0.97**. And you don’t have to be 1 to be healthy anyway.

If you work 40 hours per week and you procrastinated the last 5 of them, you can still be at 0.875. You don’t have to be productive every single waking hour anyway. Quality over quantity is what counts.

All of us fail once in a while and it’s fine. It‘is human.

That also leads to...

## Mindset Shift #2: You don’t have to say What the Hell

Whenever you realize that you’re off track, you don’t have to say what the hell.

Instead, **think about who was the one who wanted this goal**. It was *you*.

Do you still want it? If so, then acknowledge you failed a little bit. **But if you want, you can still hit the target as closely as possible.** To be 0.93 is better than 0. Even 0.5 is way better than 0.

That’s it. It is such a small thing, but it can be life-changing. It works as a nice relief.

What if you really don’t want the goal? Then it is fine. All of us have some fake goals that are just wishes or dreams that we don’t really want and we’re faking it because of some internal or external pressures.

When you realize something is a fake goal, please don’t feel guilty about not pursuing it. Instead, find a goal you feel more motivated to pursue.

Okay, now you have the correct mindset.

## Let’s finally get to work.

If you were surfing the internet all day, you’ll notice that your mind is restless. You can’t focus properly. You might want to quit immediately.

There are 2 possible ways how to solve it (combine them for the best results):

## 1. Calm down

The best one to calm yourself down is to sit down on the chair for 5 minutes, turn off the screens, and just stare at the wall or close your eyes.

Breathe. Take deep breaths. Or focus on your inhaling and exhaling.

Get bored.

Our brains are usually full of dopamine hits from the internet and we’re overwhelmed. You know that feeling.

## 2. Do the bare minimum

It’s difficult to start because we’re scared that it’s the end of fun. Or you might be scared by the sheer amount of work or scale of the project ahead of you.

Then make it less difficult or less scary:

Set up a timer for 5 or 15 minutes and do a quick outline.

Take a paper and a pencil and sketch out the first draft. Get the first quick and dirty version. Get from 0 to 0.1.

Once you’re working, you’ll realize it’s easier to keep working then it was to start working. When you get into the work, you will become curious about the problems it entails and you can even start enjoying the work you’re doing. You can get into the flow.

That’s it.

When you realize you’re failing to achieve your goal:

**Shift your mindset**

1. Realize it’s not binary, you don’t have to get to 1 (100%), 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 are all good.
2. Don’t say “What the Hell,” instead reflect on why you the goal is worth the effort for you

**Take action**

1. Take a step back and calm down. Let the restlessness go away.
2. Start with the bare minimum. Do 5 minutes of work. Create a rough outline. Write the first paragraph.

Even if your day didn’t go according to your imagination (didn’t get to 100%), it doesn’t mean it has to end at 0% satisfaction and 100% regret.

h80zwd,"i keep reading about productivity posts and how it’s hard for people to accomplish things these days. i just wanna say that it’s completely fine to be stuck in a rut for days, weeks, etc. just as long as you take little steps each day to take care of yourself. 

in my experience, i got used to comparing myself with other people’s achievements that i tend to invalidate my own progress. i learned it the hard way that everyone of us has our own pace. if it takes you a longer time to recover, that’s okay. remember: healing is not linear. it is a process. discipline is a must but cut yourself some slack sometimes.

it is okay to:
1. have a 5-minute shower than having NONE at all.
2. eat late than COMPLETELY skipping meals.
3. brush your teeth for 30 seconds than NOT brushing it at all.

this goes for other things and other dimensions in life as well. if your life has been turned upside down bc of the current crisis, know that it is ok and this is not a productivity competition. if you get to master skills and wake up early everyday, good for you. if you can’t, that’s okay. 

you can encounter setbacks and relapses every single day, but what matters is how you respond to it. you don’t necessarily have to suppress your emotions, you can just learn how to acknowledge and control it so it doesn’t control you. :)

The concept is simple—every time you complete a habit, you move a marble from one jar to another. A satisfying visual cue + a physical action = instant mini dopamine hit.

I used to rely on habit trackers in diaries or on my phone, but I’d forget to update them for 2-3 days, and then feel disconnected from the progress.
With the marbles, I’ve placed the jars in my bathroom—somewhere I go every day. So now, it’s hard to miss.
I use it to track my daily movement—workout, swim, walk, stretch, etc. And weirdly, I actually look forward to moving the marble.

But here’s what surprised me:
I thought I was active most days. But when I actually started tracking with marbles, I saw I was only moving 15–17 days a month.
That insight alone has helped me get more intentional with my goals.

Highly recommend giving this a shot if you’ve struggled with consistency or tracking in the past. It’s a small thing, but weirdly fun and grounding.

lg1wza,"The reason discipline can be so hard, is because your Present Self and Future Self are on different pages:

* **Your Future Self** wants your Present Self to do work now (in order to get positive benefits later)
* **Your Present Self** doesn't want to work now (even if that negatively impacts your Future Self)

But what if there was an alternative to this mindset?

**What if you could align the interests of your Present Self and your Future Self?**

Here's how to make that happen:

**Learn to enjoy the process (not just the end result).**

If you actually **like** working towards your goal, that changes the equation.

Now all of a sudden, your Present Self and Future Self are on the same page:

* **Your Future Self still wants the same thing:** Your Present Self to work now so it benefits later
* **But Your Present Self has changed:** Now, it wants to work too (because it enjoys doing it)

So, the question is, **how** do you convince your Present Self to enjoy the process?

That's where things get trickier. Especially with challenging goals.

**But I've practiced various methods for how to learn to enjoy the process over the years.**

And am going to share the 11 which have proven the most effective.

**If you prefer to hear these methods in video format, check out the first post in my profile.**

## Method Number 1: Seek Out Intrinsic Rewards

There are 2 types of rewards:

* **Intrinsic rewards:** Which are benefits you receive in return for the work you do that come from WITHIN.
* **And extrinsic rewards:** Which are benefits that come from OUTSIDE of yourself.

Intrinsic rewards are the most directly beneficial when it comes to enjoying the process.

**That’s because they are benefits you receive from the process itself.**

Examples include:

* The joy of learning.
* Creative expression.
* Finding humor in something.
* The positive feeling you get from helping others.
* Or simply the internal satisfaction from knowing you are doing something productive.

**Next time you are pursuing a goal, think about whether there is anything you like about what you are doing.**

Or that you can learn to like.

These things are the potential intrinsic rewards that you can start seeking.

**Then, try to focus more of your attention on the aspects you find intrinsically rewarding.**

And less of your attention on:

* **(A)** The parts of the process you don’t like.
* **And (B)** the ultimate outcome.

If it’s a challenging goal, finding something you like about it might be tough.

**But for most things, if you search deep enough, there is usually at least 1 thing you can discover that you like about it.**

## Method Number 2: Measure Your Progress in the Right Way

**When done in the RIGHT way, measuring your progress has several benefits.**

Including:

* Delivering useful feedback.
* Helping improving future performance.
* And providing inspiration.

**But if you measure your progress in the WRONG way, you can get overly focused on the outcome.**

And when you become excessively tied to how well you are doing, you often start to get more:

* Anxious
* Worried
* And self-doubting

Even when things DO go well, if you focus too much on results, you can feel:

* Prideful
* Egotistical
* And vain

Which aren’t helpful emotions for long-term happiness.

**So, how do you measure your progress in a way that gives you the pros without the cons?**

Here are a few suggestions:

* **Measure the smallest increments of progress possible:** This helps you find joy in every step in the journey. For example, if you are lifting weights, assess your progress based on something small like pushing for 1 more rep. Rather than something big like “gaining 20lbs of muscle.”
* **Don’t look at big picture success metrics too often:** Every once in a while, looking at those broader metrics can be helpful to make sure you are headed in the right direction. But if you become overly fixated on the big picture you are increasing the likelihood you will get discouraged. Because often it takes a long time to get there. Especially for larger goals.
* **Use measurements to improve performance:** Measurements are most beneficial when they are used to inform changes to your process. Used in this way, measurements can help make things more efficient or effective. Which will in turn make the process more enjoyable.
* **Don’t forget to make note of intrinsic accomplishments:** For example, if you are writing a story and felt you really leveled up creatively, count that as progress. Whether or not your story makes money or gets positive feedback. Of course, the money or feedback may matter too, but you don’t want to discount the skill you’ve built. And who knows, it may pay off in the long run.

## Method Number 3: Minimize Distractions

**It’s going to be impossible to uncover aspects of the process you love, if you are constantly getting distracted.**

That’s because you need to be able to deeply focus in on the process in order to find things you like about it.

**So, if at all possible, try to create an environment where you can pursue your goals with minimal opportunity for interruption.**

For example:

* **If you are writing a paper,** consider using an app to block distracting programs from drawing your attention away from the task at hand.
* **When journaling,** do that in a different place than where you typically play games and watch TV.
* **Or if you are trying to learn to play guitar,** perhaps you hide some tempting snacks you have out first.

The key is to think through your goals and come up with a plan to limit the distractions for each.

**Sometimes it also helps to meditate for a few minutes before starting a task.**

Meditation can help clear your mind so you are less preoccupied with things that might distract you.

## Method Number 4: Give Yourself Credit for the Little Things

**Another thing that can really help you learn to love the process, is to give yourself credit along the way.**

The key here, is not just to wait until you achieve your ultimate goal.

**Rather, to find ways to feel good about your progress continuously along your journey.**

If you want, you can even give yourself mini rewards after completing certain steps.

And it’s totally fine if these are extrinsic rewards.

Like:

* Playing a game for an hour.
* Watching a movie.
* Or treating yourself to a snack you like.

**These small rewards can help to positively reinforce the aspects of the process that you carried out.**

Which can eventually translate into intrinsic satisfaction with those components. Even if those extrinsic rewards aren’t always present.

## Method Number 5: Journal

**Journaling can help make you more aware of the specific things you did process-wise.**

Instead of just forgetting those details, you have a chance to reflect on them.

**And as you increase your awareness, you will have more opportunities to find things that interest you.**

Journaling can also help you process any negative feelings you experience.

If you don’t want to officially journal, informal reflection can also help.

## Method Number 6: Focus on the Things You Can Control

**Depending on your particular goal and situation, there may be a ton of stuff outside of your control which affect the outcome.**

Things like:

* Getting sick.
* The state of the economy.
* Other people’s actions.
* And plain old luck.

**If you are able to focus less on the aspects of the process you CAN’T control, you will have a lot more energy to devote to the things which you CAN control.**

Understandably, this is easier said than done. And in some situations, not possible.

But the more you can focus on things which are within your sphere of influence, the easier it will be for you to enjoy the process.

## Method Number 7: Don’t Compare Yourself With Others

**When you get lost in comparing your success to other people, it’s going to be tough for you to enjoy the process.**

Since you are placing so much importance on your relative outcome.

**Comparing yourself can also produce negative emotions like:**

* Jealousy
* Self-loathing
* And resentment

These negative emotions can make it even harder for you to enjoy the process.

**Now, clearly, there may be some situations where you have to compare yourself to others a little bit.**

For example, if you are in a competitive situation, like playing a sport.

**But even then, there’s a helpful way and an unhelpful way to evaluate how you are doing vs. competitors:**

* **The unhelpful way** is to get demoralized because you aren’t as far along as someone else.
* **The helpful way** is to break down what it is those other people are doing and try to emulate those tactics to improve your own performance. This approach allows you to still shift your mind towards the process, while also leveling up your skills.

## Method Number 8: Adjust Your Process to Make it More Enjoyable

**So, you may be wondering, what about goals where you simply can’t find anything about the process you like?**

In these situations, I like to try to adjust the process to make it more enjoyable.

Or at least less painful.

Here are a few ways to do that:

* **Increase efficiency:** Find better ways to do things or to make things more streamlined. For example, once I had a work assignment in Excel which I hated doing initially. But then I was able to start using an Excel formula that made the part of the process I hated much easier. Which actually led me to start liking the assignment.
* **Mix things up:** Sometimes you might be going about something in a way which isn’t optimal for you. In those situations, it sometimes helps to mix things up a bit. For example, if you are doing a diet which involves a bunch of foods you hate, switch to a different diet that allows tastier foods.
* **Integrate something new into the process:** For instance, listening to a podcast or music during a workout. In some ways this may seem in opposition to focusing deeply on the process. But if you are doing something really difficult, it can sometimes be the only way you are going to truly enjoy things. I personally listen to podcasts or music during workouts on an “as needed” basis.

## Method Number 9: Make a List of Everything You Like About Pursuing Each Goal

It can be very helpful to brainstorm what it is you like (or could potentially learn to like) about your goals.

**For example, here is my list of things I like about working out:**

* The endorphin rush I feel after each rep.
* The feeling that I am using my body effectively.
* The fun motions of doing certain lifts or movements.
* Being aware that I am improving my health.
* A sense of accomplishment from knowing I am working towards my goal.
* Listening to podcasts or music (on days I am struggling to focus fully on the process).
* Getting to know my body better.
* Talking to the gym staff or other members.
* Appreciating the times my wife and I go together.
* Being a part of a community (both the gym itself and the broader workout community).
* Learning more about weightlifting (including figuring out new exercises).
* The relief and pleasure I feel in between sets.

**And the biggest thing of all:**

The fact that I know exactly what I need to do while working out, and nothing else matters at that point.

None of my usual debates over what to do and how to handle certain situations in my life.

In that moment, I just work out, and that’s all there is.

**Keep in mind, I’ve been working on this one for a while, so even if your list is just 1 thing at first, that is totally fine.**

1 thing you like is plenty to start with.

Also, for some really challenging pursuits, 1 thing you like might be all that is possible.

## Method Number 10: Practice

**The only way you are going to figure out how to learn to enjoy the process, is to practice it.**

That’s because:

* **A)** You aren’t going to learn to enjoy something you aren’t doing.
* **And (B)** the more you practice it the easier it will become to enjoy it. Since the hard things will get less difficult as your abilities improve. And because you will discover more things you like about it.

**So, whatever you do, get out there and give it a try!**

Learning to love the process isn’t going to happen from thinking about it alone.

## Method Number 11: Don’t Put Pressure on Yourself to Enjoy the Process All the Time

**Don’t feel like you have to enjoy the process every single moment.**

Unless you are a superhero, that probably isn’t possible.

**This is for a few reasons:**

* It can take a long time to figure out how to learn to enjoy the process for each goal that you have.
* Focusing a little on the outcome in certain situations makes sense and is totally fine.
* Some things are just incredibly difficult, and focusing on the process in those situations might be extremely hard.

All of this is perfectly natural.

**In a way, figuring out how to learn to enjoy the process, is a process in and of itself.**

4o0vos,"**Quitting bad habits is EASY, you've just been using the wrong method!** 

Normally people quit a habit using willpower, but willpower is a limited resource.

When we rely on willpower we encounter ego-depletion - We lose all motivation to keep fighting and give in to our raging craving.

For example:

When you first quit, you can do well for a few days... 

Then you start to think *""Maybe just this one time""* or *""I've been good, I can just do it a little""*.

And you give in.

But don't worry, **THERE IS ANOTHER WAY:**

Using this strange method, I have quit alcohol, sugar, binge eating, smoking, porn and procrastination.

As a result I have lost 70 pounds, found a girlfriend, quit all medication and I wake up with a smile on my face.

Here is the method:


1) Meet your Addiction Voice (AV)

You bad habit or addiction has it's own voice, the AV. 

The AV wants you to give in to your cravings, and works by hijacking your inner monologue. 

It will say things in your own voice like *""Why don't you just smoke one more time, it won't do any harm!""* or *""You need to smoke, or you will get grumpy and damage your relationships.""* 

The truth is:

**Everything the AV says is a lie to get you to give in to your bad habit.**


2) Learn to recognise your AV

Your AV can be brought to light by making The Law.

The Law is unbreakable, and doesn't require any willpower to follow.

Does it require willpower for you not to steal a car or rob a bank?

NO! 

The Law cannot be broken at any point. 

Write down your law if it helps, but the most important part is defining it. 

E.g. ""I will never smoke again"".

But how can this help you recognise your AV? 

**Because any thought that pops in your head that contradicts the law is the AV, not you.**


3) Create an AV Avatar

Assign an avatar to your AV. 

For example, my smoking AV was an old, ugly man who chain smoked and had cancer.

Whenever I'd hear him say *""Go on, just have a quick one, it can't hurt!""* I'd say ""Screw you old man"" and give him the finger.

This also helps with cravings. 

**Cravings aren't really happening to you, they are happening to your AV avatar.** 

Your AV Avatar wants to give in, not you! 

Without you giving in, they will disappear and die! 

Your true self is already free of this addiction, so the cravings aren't happening to you, they are happening to your AV.


Extra tips:

* NEVER NEGOTIATE. If you keep playing with your AV and trying to argue, you will just end up giving in. AS SOON AS YOUR RECOGNISE YOUR AV, SHUT IT DOWN.

* Make your avatar ugly, not friendly. They are the scum of the earth. My binge avatar was a pig - not a cute little one, a fat smelly, warty one.

* Always remember, your AV cannot make you do anything. All it can do is speak to you, you don't have to do what it says!

* Your cravings and voice will disappear faster than you realise, but NEVER let your guard down. 

Now go out there and kick your AV's ass and say goodbye to your bad habit!

qqkhe4,"I'm not sure where I picked it up, might have been atomic habits (phenomenal book if you suffer from time management/procrastination issues), but I coded for a minimum of 5 minutes nearly every day for a year and a half and I am on week 2 of my career as a software engineer at a phenomenal company. I had a lot of help and have a good friend who is a software engineer who taught me a lot. I had know idea how to code a year and a half ago but just decided I was going to do it because the money is great, I like computers, and it would enable me to live the lifestyle I want (working remotely, setting my own schedule).

I have trouble taking the first step, and knowing that I only had to do 5 minutes made it easier to actually open my laptop and start studying. Some days I only did 5 minutes and some days I worked for hours, but I stayed consistent and it finally paid off. Having this incredible job hasn't solved all my problems (it certainly helps lol) and I need to apply this rule to other parts of my life, but I just wanted to say it works. Focus on consistency because that's what gets you to the finish line. Feels incredible.

Edit: Sorry if this is unclear, but I did not code only 5 minutes a day for a year and a half and become a software engineer. I made sure I coded *at least* 5 minutes a day. That is the trick. If you force yourself to do at least 5 minutes, most of the time you end up doing more. Almost all of my sessions coding are several hours long. Some are just 5 minutes. The key is that I am consistent and the five minute rule makes it so that I code constantly and don't stop.

Final Edit: Would it really be reddit if I didn't have people in the comments telling me I'm not actually a software engineer because I don't have a degree? Disclaimer: becoming a software engineer is fucking hard. It is not normal to become a software engineer in 1.5 years. Maybe a dev, but SWE is more difficult. I had a mentor who was already a SWE, so the learning process was much easier for me and expedited dramatically. Becoming a dev in 1.5 years is very realistic. If you want to expedite the process/shoot higher, find a mentor or an internship. I don't know when this post started being received as me saying ""HEY EVERYONE, BECOME A SWE IN 1.5 YEARS WITH THIS SIMPLE TRICK!!1! SOFTWARE ENGINEERS HATE HIM!!"" It doesn't work like that. Most people do not have the patience or interest to become a SWE. This is just me telling my story and detailing a technique that worked for me. Use it in whatever you're trying to achieve. Sorry some of you are upset that I hold a Software Engineer title, my response to you is to cry about it while I debug this React Native app :~) if you’re an engineer telling me I can’t call myself an engineer without an engineering degree, I have two suggestions: 1) Google “does a software engineer need an engineering degree” and 2) find some hobbies/interests outside of gatekeeping.

Any time you have the urge to go check your phone or check your social media, and you feel like you need a lot of willpower to resist the urge, you may feel like you're too weak to resist or you just can't, that's WHEN you should resist it. That's the most important time to do it.
  
  Sometimes the urge is so bad that you start heating, and it becomes unbearable, a very uncomfortable feeling . Show your greatest power when you feel the weakest.

Because you feel like you are fundamentally broken, and flawed, and bad. You isolate your bad habits and try to excise them like a malignant tumor, only to find that they've seemingly metastasized and have pervaded your entire waking life like some kind of horror movie monster. The panic is indescribable. The pain is indescribable. And you're doing it to yourself, because you want the results, but you don't want to do the work.

The latest fad ""challenge"" will never work for the same reason the latest fad diet will never work. Weight loss isn't something you can trick your body into doing by adding turmeric to your bagel, and discipline isn't something you can trick your mind into doing by not looking at your computer for a few days.

If you want to try doing a challenge, that's fine. But that's not the most efficient way to learn the essential skills of inspiration, motivation, and discipline, just like a 7 day ""fitness challenge"" is not the most efficient way to lose weight. Change takes time and a lot of work, and it starts with 2 fundamental principles:

1. Respect yourself
2. Do the right thing

Now, how does your challenge help you do either of these? It doesn't, because it is meant to give you the feeling of progress you crave without doing any of the work.

Anything you do to build discipline must be **small** and **permanent.** Start journalling at the end of the day. Go for a walk when you get out of bed. Plug in your phone so it's not the first thing you grab when you get up. Set goals and then achieve them.

Please choose to focus on what's important (yourself) instead of some get-disciplined-quick snake oil solution.

EDIT: This post has a lot of attention, and to a degree that I don't know it was intended to get. Don't get my point misconstrued: I said at the very beginning that doing bad things is bad, and we could all stand to do good things more. The idea behind these challenges is that you can work hard to change your habits, and that is not something that could ever be called into question. 

The SPECIFIC thing that I was fighting against, and have been fighting against for years internally, is the idea that you can just flip a switch and all your bad habits will go away. This is a toxic and maladaptive idea. If you binge on junk food and then purge it from your body, you have a serious eating disorder. If you binge on all your bad habits and then purge them from your life, you have a serious mental health disorder. Changing your bad habits into good healthy habits takes hard work and it starts with small things. While the dopamine detox and the superman challenge and every other quick-fix challenge you can think of certainly do spark you into action, it may not always be the kind of disciplinary groundwork you have to lay in order to achieve your goals.

jbgmao,"I love to write and recently I’ve started typing up a journal entry every day. It’s actually been a really good way to boost my self confidence and I never really realize what productive things I do until I write them all down into the entry. It also gives me an incentive to be productive and do small things that I know I will want to write down in the journal that night. I suggest just trying for a couple days, start today, and see how it goes.
I think it could help a lot of people here and just in general.

1mnbrpf,"Tbh, I used to think I was just “lazy"" after high school, I told myself I’d work out, start my side hustle, fix my sleep, read more… all that. But every time, I’d hype myself up for a day or two, then quit.  I’d wake up, grab my phone, scroll for an hour, feel guilty, and tell myself: \[i will start tommorow\] fr, I did that for 4 years. Tomorrow became weeks. Weeks became years. I watched other people win, build businesses, get fit, level up their lives… while I stayed exactly where I was. I thought maybe I was just wired wrong or not meant for more. 

Here’s the harsh truth I wish someone told me straight up: motivation is a myth. Discipline is what saves you when motivation dies and trust me, it will. These are the 3 rules that finally broke my cycle:

1 Start embarrassingly small.  
I stopped trying to “overhaul” my life. I just did 5 push-ups, read 1 page, and worked for 5 minutes. Every. Single. Day. It was too small to fail.

2. Never miss twice.  
I will miss a day. You will miss a day. The golden rule: don’t miss two in a row. One slip is human, two is a habit forming in the wrong direction.

3. Identity > Goals.  
Instead of “I want to run,” I told myself: I am a runner*.* Instead of “I want to read,” I told myself: I am a reader*.* When your identity shifts, your actions follow.

fwg2r0,"I ruined my life in my early teenage years. I was a total mess from 18-25. Well I was a mess before 18 too but I wasn’t aware of it, which was cool because it didn’t hurt. I saw that I was a mess when my friendships started to fade away because I was always behind everyone else. Less money, less education, less everything. 

You know you messed up when the kid that you bullied in school becomes your boss and you’re a cashier.

I was frustrated, angry and full of resentment towards my parents and my circumstances… For a long time I blamed my parents. Until one day when I sat down and started wondering why is my life so messed up? Most of the reasons were my own decisions and very few because of the circumstances I grew up in. It was something hard to swallow. But I was determined to change my life.

Luckily most of my problems were self-inflicted. Why luckily? Because I knew that I could change. It was a choice.

I have battled a huge 10 year old gambling addiction which literally ruined me. I’m not talking only financially but emotionally and spiritually too. Ruined relationships and years of my life. Besides gambling all I did was masturbating and procrastinating all day long. I knew that if I could kill these 3 unhealthy habits my life will change or at least wouldn’t be so miserable.

My whole life I was good at 2 things. Boxing and marketing. I started boxing from a very young age and I was pretty talented… and marketing… let’s just say that I used to sell stuff. 

I knew that my boxing ages were behind me and I couldn’t make it big from that so I kept boxing as a hobby and “put all my eggs in my marketing basket”. More specifically direct marketing/affiliate marketing.

Well I failed miserably for two years. Tens of failures if not hundreds. The thing is, I was used to fail. Very used, maybe too used… so it was normal to me. When I was gambling I was losing money daily, you know how it works… So failure wasn’t anything new or out of the ordinary to me.

After two years things started to work for me. I will not tell you how much money I’m making and how I’m living now because it’s not relevant, also I wouldn’t call myself rich but at least well off. 

Here are 6 things that you need to understand when you want to change your life.

1. Habits are everything. 99% of your future successes are done by your habits, also your failures too. Habits can make you your best version of yourself but they also can ruin you. Habits are like superpowers. Boring superpowers but still superpowers.
2. Perseverance. Don’t just give up on things. It’ll eventually work out. And if it doesn’t try something else as many times as needed. You’ll never regret something that you tried but you’ll always regret something that you didn’t. Regret is a huge motivator for me. 
3. Success is not a straight line. Oh no. Most things never work from the beginning so don’t get frustrated and dwell on your losses too much. Learn to let go. Don’t get attached to your ideas.
4. Listen to your inner voice. You know when you’re doing something that you shouldn’t, right? That little voice doesn’t tell you what to do but it does tell you what NOT to do. Listen to it when it says: not to eat that 5th chocolate or not the open you 3rd bottle of beer.
5. Read/write a lot. Learn from other peoples mistakes.
6. Be your own hero and start things backwards. It may not be the right expression but English is not my first language so you’ll have to forgive me. I’ll explain what I mean. I bet you always imagine yourself that when you achieve this or that you’re going to change your lifestyle and your habits. The thing is you have to change your lifestyle and habits first and then to expect to become successful, not the other way.

nimd55,"As I grow older, I start to realize how true the saying ""you are your worst enemy"" is. When I was a younger man, I used to think that the enemy was outside. I always split the world into friends and rivals, good guys and antagonists, dark and light. It was always something out there that was preventing me from progress. But I've learned to view the world in multiple shades of gray now. Looking at the world through these ""shades of gray"", I realized it was always me. Or rather, it was always ""another side"" of me. Me? How it could it be me? After all, THEY are always doing things to me! Maybe. But who's the one who takes to heart the things that THEY tell you?

I view the human personality to not be ""one"" but ""fragments"". Meaning, we have various variations of our personality that emerge when triggered in response to something. Normally, these ""split personalities"" would resolve themselves and merge into ""one person"" more or less but sometimes that doesn't always happen. Many times, there is a traumatic incident early on in one's life that prevents one (or many) personalities from merging into the larger personality and they become ""stragglers"" more or less in our consciousness. They wait right under the surface for the ideal time for them to come out and do whatever it is they need to do. This might be when you're tired, lonely, frustrated, or intoxicated.

After something happens, you'll be like ""I don't know what got into me"". Well, it's not about ""what got into you"" it's about ""what came out of you"". And what came out of you was a darker side usually hidden from view.

As for myself, I had to get these other facets of my personality in line if I ever wanted to live a life worth meaning. I literally had to face my shadows. I realized this at 23, I'm 29 now. After all, I was the one who didn't ask girls out. I was the one who didn't negotiate his salary at his first job. I was the one who loved smoking weed. I was the one who fell deep into erotica. I was the one who ""held back"", who wanted what was comfortable.

To start the process, I had to flex my willpower muscle and just fight against it. No, you can't surf the Internet randomly. No, you can't stay up past 11pm. No, you can't take drugs. No, you can't pity yourself. No, you can't watch explicit videos. No, you can't eat that burger. No, you can't stay up till 1AM texting random people. I literally had to be like an adult to a child who just wanted pleasure and instant gratification. After all, that's what it was - a part of me that refused to grow up and get integrated due to different traumatic events in my childhood.

Then, I started slowly to develop habits. Zero days a week at the gym turned into 5 over time. Random Internet surfing became nonexistent over time. A nonexistent writing habit turned into 20 minutes of journaling every single day. Saving none of my paycheck became 15% as the years passed. No meditation transformed into 30 minute sessions in the morning and at night. Multiple people having sway over my mood turned into me being a grounded and unshakable man.

Am I perfect now? Definitely not. But over the past several years, I have developed a state where I am less at war with myself and I am able to get myself in line to do what needs to be done. I am actually in hot pursuit of my goals instead of randomly wishing they would occur. I am focused. I am disciplined. I am conscientious - all of the things my 19 year old self wishes he could be.

So anyone that's reading this - look at yourself and ask ""what elements of my personality are holding me back and how can I get them on my side?"" You may have a part of yourself that doesn't like getting up in the morning. That's worth taking a look at. You may have a part of yourself that doesn't like to study. That's worth examining.

All of these things. They're all worth looking at. After all, if you don't - who will?",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] It's you vs. you.,1754,1.0
6sic3n,"**Practical Stoicism Tools**

Stoicism philosophy is on the rise. I have been practising it for a couple of years now and would like to share 3 of the most effective and practical mental exercise/meditations that I have used.

[**TL:DR: VIDEO POST**](https://youtu.be/z1j8tvQBNmE)

##**Method One: A view from above**##

*'You can rid yourself of many useless things among those that disturb you, for they lie entirely in your imagination; and you will then gain for yourself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in your mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of every part of everything, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution'* 

**– Marcus Aurelius**

Marcus Aurelius advises us to perform an exercise called 'view from above'. This exercise involves us envisioning ourselves from the third person. In this vision, we zoom out while keeping ourselves in the centre. We continue zooming out and contemplating the scale of the universe.  For instance, your first zoom might encompass a view of you from above the roof of your house. Increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your street, increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your country. Keep going until you can picture a view of Earth from the stars. 

With this scale, we can gain a better perspective on the insignificance of our problems. When compared to the universe whatever problems we might appear incredibly trivial.  For instance, if you were feeling down because a girl flaked on you or someone insulted you, try this exercise. It is far easier to overcome the emotional hurdles we experience when we put things into perspective. 

##**Method Two: Negative visualization**##

*'Remember that all we have is “on loan” from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission—indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.'*

**- Seneca**

Negative visualization despite the name is an exercise that will increase your default level of happiness if practised consistently.The exercise consists of you envisioning what it would feel like if you lost certain things from your life. 
Some of the things that you could consider during the exercise are:

•	How it would feel to not have a roof over your head.

•	How it would feel to lose social status.

•	How it would feel to live in a third world country.

•	How it would feel to have a physical disability.

•	How it would feel to lose a loved one.

This exercise is not meant to be dark or morbid, it’s meant to put things into perspective. Allowing you to see how lucky you truly are. It also prepares you for the worst case scenarios in which one of these things does happen. **You are not meant to fixate on these thoughts, but consider them from time to time.**

This is a very practical way for you to practice gratitude, naturally, when you consider things being removed from your life, you start to gain a sense of gratitude.
 Now gratitude is important because of a thing called ‘hedonic adaptation’, basically, it’s a term that defines the tendency for humans to always go back to their default level of happiness. 

If you won the lotto and became a millionaire, your base level of happiness will increase for a while. However, when you become accustomed to the lifestyle, despite all the new toys, you will return to your base level.
 Gratitude breaks this pattern, allowing you to enjoy each step on the ladder. You can be grateful when you own a box, and you can be grateful when you own a Lamborghini Avendator.  

##**Method Three: Voluntary Discomfort**##

*'But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winter training, and prepare himself, and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him'*

**- Epictetus**

The last exercise has been advised to us by Epictetus. It is called 'voluntary discomfort'. In this exercise, we are going to deliberately put ourselves through uncomfortable situations. We will do this in order to train ourselves to not hold onto comfort with such high regard.
We can perform voluntary discomfort in a number of ways.
Some suggestions are:

•	Cold Showers

•	NoFap

•	Exercising in the morning 

•	Walking in the cold without a jumper

•	Fasting for a day

•	Sleeping on the floor

All these things will change your relationship with comfort. Once you overcome the need for comfort, life will become much easier. Setting your goals and sticking to them will be far easier. When most people complain about being ‘uncomfortable’, you won’t be able to relate. You are literally training yourself to be like a Navy Seal. This method will harden you up for life.

 Eventually shit will hit the fan at some stage during your life. You want to have to mental and physical fortitude to weather the storm.

So those are the three stoic exercises. Stoicism is a practical philosophy that has survived the test of time due to its universal applications. If you practice these stoic meditations, you will be well on your way to the good life.

",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] I have been practicing Stoicism for 3 years now and the quality of my life and overall discipline has increased dramatically because of these 3 exercises. One from each of the greats: Epictetus, Seneca, And Marcus Aurelius",1748,0.95

ksabs5,"Whether or not something is good or bad is impossible to know in the moment. If you lose your job, then that would seem like a disaster at the time. However, if you get a better job, then you will look back at that job loss as a good thing. Same thing for positive events. If you eat your favourite meal, that would seem like a great thing at the time, but if it gives you food poisoning then you will look back at that meal negatively.

Simply put, at the point of an event, you don’t have enough information to know if it is good or bad.

I have been meditating over how frequently wrong I misjudge things and this has made me more productive. When I don’t feel like doing something important, I will get thoughts like “This task sucks. I’m bored. Poor me. It’s going to take forever” etc. These thoughts then bring my mood down and I become unproductive. But the work still has to be done so I end up doing it, but I’m in a terrible mood and it takes twice as long. The first chunk of time is spent internally moaning and the second part is the reluctant doing. All I get is a whole lot of unnecessary suffering in the process.

However, now I have been applying my philosophy of “What if I’m wrong?” about a situation. If I know I should cook dinner but want to get takeaway, I will question my thoughts. “What if I’m wrong that a takeout would be better than a home cooked meal?”, “What if I’m wrong that cooking sucks and is difficult?”. Before, if I felt like a task was going to suck, then I would just accept that as truth. But now, I just say I’m unsure. Even if I have done the task before, there are all kinds of biological factors (hunger, tiredness) that could change how painful something will or will not be.

The only way to get clarity is to experiment. I get out of my head, where everything seems awful, and move to action. I do a small experimental action, observe it, and then mentally record how bad it was. So in the dinner situation, I’ll say “Okay, I’ll run an experiment, to see if cooking dinner is harder than takeout. I will cook dinner for the next 5 minutes and observe how painful it is”. After the 5 minutes, I will reconsider. If I’m still really hating life then I might still get takeout. But the decision feels less oppressive because I tried. And generally speaking, I’ll have a bit of momentum once the task is started which makes continuing easier. Then when I’m done, I’ll conclude to myself “see, I thought this was going to majorly suck , and overall it was a bit of effort, but nowhere near as hard as I thought it would be”.

And that conclusion I’ll remind myself of when I find myself procrastinating on the next task. In general, I think we overestimate how hard something will be and we don’t give ourselves enough credit for our ability to complete hard tasks. So don't force yourself to do anything, instead run a little experiment to see if you are right about a task being good or bad. I guarantee you'll get some great results.",r/getdisciplined,You are probably wrong about how much effort is required to complete a task [Advice],1741,0.99
ju51ho,"If you think about what you need to be happy, you might think about achieving something in your career, or a relationship, or something you own. All of these things have something in common - they're conditions for happiness. As human beings we naturally get attached to goals and the status quo.

The bad news is that not everything in our career goes as we would like, relationships can end, possessions break and are lost. The good news is that you can enjoy what you have right now and be happy, even if the only thing that you possess is the ability to breathe in and out. 

By letting go of our attachment to things that we believe we need to be happy we can actually live calmer, happier lives. Of course its great to enjoy the things we own, the people we love and our work - but accepting that life will change and that we don't need external conditions for happiness reduces the suffering we feel when things don't go as we hope.

* When choosing to follow advice, be it from a book or a reddit post, if you think it makes sense - be careful to REALLY, FULLY follow it.
   * Don't follow only part of it
   * Don't think ""Yeah, good idea"" and then don't do it
   * DO make a point to go practice , step by step, many times until you can be sure you're actually doing it.
   * DO realize that following a new idea needs PRACTICE. Many of these things are **skills** that you can't just do perfectly immediately even if they sound very easy.
   * DO **write it down.**
   * I highly recommend reading the books yourself, of course.
      * They go much deeper than my post.
      * I listened to some on audible, I think self help books are great for this.

&#x200B;

* ***Keep a folder (paper or digital) to organize your life.*** *(Getting Things Done, Eat That Frog)*
   * Regardless of your technology (specifically fancy apps), making a plan is based on you sitting down and deciding what to do.
   * Always think on paper. Write everything down.
   * I can recommend **Atoma** or **M by Staples** (Notebooks with freely exchangeable pages). Anything else works, too.

&#x200B;

>Personally, I have a folder that has seperators for the following six sections:

&#x200B;

1. ***Set GOALS***  *(Eat that frog)****.***
   1. Goal-setting is a specific skill that you might think you know how to but actually don't. Setting goals right is simple, but not easy. There is a specific way to do it. I have the words memorized. EVERY SINGLE WORD IS IMPORTANT. I'm not kidding. (Example: If you ""decide exactly what you **should""**, it won't work!
      1. **Decide** **exactly** what **you** **want**.
      2. Set a **deadline**.
      3. **List** **all** **steps**.
      4. Make a **plan**.
      5. **Do** something **on that plan** **immediately**. ANYTHING.
   2. I also have an ""IN"" List as the first list in the goals section. Whatever pops into my mind goes there. I can decide later if it's a goal, a task on a category list, a task for this week... *(Getting Things Done).*
2. ***Keep lists of tasks for the DAY, WEEK, MONTH*** *(Eat that frog).*
   1. In the evening, plan the next day.
   2. On sunday, plan the next week.
   3. Keep a list for the next month that you constantly add tasks to.
3. ***Limit your work hours by keeping an UNSCHEDULE*** *(The Now Habit)****.***
   1. Procrastination is your mind fearing that you won't get to do all the good things if you work too much. To combat this, keep an unschedule - the opposite of a schedule.
      1. Print a weekly schedule that shows all 24 hours.
      2. Block out all the time you're NOT working. Like time for eating, your routine, guilt-free playtime, sleep, appointments, commutes etc.
      3. At least one hour of guilt-free play is MANDATORY. Plan it in the unschedule. It's actually better to plan more free time because it makes it clear that work time is limited.
      4. DO NOT plan ANY work. After you've completed some work, highlight the time you've been working in the unschedule, but only if it was at least half an hour. Sum up the day's hours worked on your #1 project.
4. ***Keep LOGS***  *(The Now Habit, Willpower).*
   1. Logs work, that's scientifically proven. I don't care why but they work.
   2. If you want to get up earlier, keep a log of your getting up times. If you want to study more, keep a log of your actual time studied. If you waste too much time, keep a general activity log. If you eat too much, keep a food log. Even without anything else, logs have a powerful positive effect.
5. ***COMMITMENT STATEMENT*** *(Me).*
   1. I have an extra section after the logs where I have written out my commitment to my most important project. Write this when you see things clearly, when you are motivated. Later, when you are tired and indecisive, it will help you remember your conviction.
6. ***Keep lists of TASKS by category*** *(Getting Things Done).*
   1. Lists help you shelving stuff that you can't do right now. It's out of your mental loop, which frees up mental space/attention.
   2. Some of my lists: Activities for guilt-less play, Chores, Routine (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), Waiting for \[notes about delegated work or results outstanding\].

&#x200B;

>Further strategies and insights (that only work if you have set up the system above):

&#x200B;

* ***Always do the most important thing first.*** *(Eat That Frog).*
   * Only one thing can be the most important goal in your life. Resolve to work on it every day. Never do any less important **work** (work is not play!) before the most important task is done.
   * It's usually the hardest and most complex task **(!)**

&#x200B;

* ***Keep your barrier to entry low.*** *(The Now Habit)*
   * Aim for LITTLE. Half an hour per day is enough sometimes. Don't spend more that five hours a day on one project - HARD RULE!
   * Keep this sentence as your mantra for work: I **choose** to **start** on one small step, knowing I have **plenty** of time for **play**.

&#x200B;

* ***Keep in mind that you are always free.*** *(Eat That Frog)*
   * Procrastination is an unconscious fear for freedom that leads to avoidance. Your mind doesn't like to be forced to work because it fears for your freedom to do other things.
   * That's why the unschedule works - you give yourself the assurance that you will be able to do all the other things, including plain fun things, too!

&#x200B;

* ***Procrastination is a little like fear, and you can fight it*** *(Me) (KEY POINT).*
   * Procrastination keeps you from thinking ""straight"" (thinking in the manner that you would like to think in order to be productive). Before it appears, everything seems nice and logical and you know what you should do. When it appears and you procrastinate instead of doing what you deciced to do, you **cannot** rely ON YOUR OWN MIND to correct itself. Your thinking itself is corrupted! In this impaired thinking state you CANNOT do the correct thing by **only** using your mind BECAUSE IT IS IMPAIRED.
   * You need to use a written commitment, read it over and over again and actually fight to start NOW. It is an actual fight that you can win. Objectively, starting on your work is completely harmless - you know that! It's just the habit of a certain unconscious fear that keeps you from doing it. You can break through and fight it. You only need to get to half an hour.
   * I'm serious. **When your goals are clear and your free time is secured, when everything that's left unplanned is the one, the most difficult, the most important task: FORCE starting. You will be surprised - The task isn't that bad! But you DO need to FORCE yourself to start.**

&#x200B;

>Also consider sleep:

&#x200B;

* ***Regular sleeping and eating patterns are important*** *(12 Rules for Life)*
   * Many people don't fully realize this, but those have an enormous positive effect on your psyche *(12 Rules for life)*.
   * In order to get control over your patterns you need to get control over your sleep.
   * Getting up early is seen as a feat of discipline. I think it's more like a ""marker"" of discipline: It automatically happens when you get your life in order. Just getting up early doesn't do anything - You have the same number of hours in a day. So aiming for it is actually not very important. But as you get control of your life, you get control of your wakeup time, and if people have control over it, they mostly choose to get up earlier rather than later (Me).

   * If you want to get up early, you need to sleep early.
   * If you want to sleep early, you need to be **tired** early.
   * If you drink caffeine, it fucks with your tiredness. A lot. Even if you only drink it in the morning.

&#x200B;

* ***You might be addicted to the internet which fucks up your sleep.*** *(Me)*
   * When you are up too late, what are you doing? Are you on the web? Passively browsing is not tiring, it's keeping you awake. If you don't do it, you will be more tired than if you do.
   * Maybe you're always procrastinating by spending time online, on reddit, youtube, netflix... It is hard to see this objectively because it has become a habit, but you might be addicted. Addicted just means that you can't stop even if you want to. So test this by DECIDING, as a test, to not waste time on the internet for a week. If you can't do it, you're addicted. It's very easy to brush this off as ridiculous or unimportant, but it's not. The bad part isn't the internet, it's the addiction and the time. It's the things that you're missing like lots of bodily activity, more time with friends, more time outside. Life.
   * I can recommend getting a kitchenSafe for locking away your electronics for longer periods of time or at night. If you haven't spent a day without lots of internet use in the last year, Try it - it might show you something about yourself that you need to know.
   * Make it a goal to spend x amount of time offline. You decide how much - whatever sounds right to you.

k3yosj,"I use this ""If, then"" mindset quite often and it puts momentum to where I want to go and what I want to do. This can be a food for thought to some who struggles with taking action.

I discovered this when I was having this self-help stage in my life and I didn't find an easy explanation to this at the time. I only discovered this after reading tons of self help books and watching tons in youtube as well.

I created a simple blueprint for me to follow whenever I want something. It is the ""If, then"" mindset

So a great example of this is with a simple sentence:

- I want to start working out, but I don't have the time.
- I want to make art but I am too exhausted.
- I want a camera but I have no money

Here is how to change that with the ""if, then"" rule:

-If I want to start working out, then I have to find a suitable schedule to do it.

-If I want to make art, then I have to figure out how to avoid exhausting myself.

-If I want to buy a camera, then I have to start budgeting to save from my daily allowance.

>The formula is:
>If I want to (goal), then I have to (simple solution you can start right away then gradually progress)

It is a matter of finding the right question, to find the best answer. It can serve as a pathway or a guide to your goal rather than a full solution. A good practice is after asking this, you can start searching for the things you need to do to reach your goals:


>The solution is I need to find suitable schedule for workout, then start to try working out in morning.
if it wont fit then try lunch time tomorrow... Not again? Try night time... Not again?! Try weekends... (And so on)


This is a simple trick that I use to control my mind's belief of what is possible and what is not. It helps to give your mind a habit of thinking for solutions rather than thinking of excuses. It doesn't give you the solution at the first few times but the more you do it, the better answers you will get. 

This formula can be useful to many things, The only thing to be cautious about this rule is to be careful with the questions you ask. It is important to choose wisely, and also to keep on asking and searching for the best answer. 

I hope you guys got something from this, It is hard to master at first if you are used to excuses but you will get there :)

EDIT: It is important to use the formula in the right way as changing it will make a different sentence and might cause anxiety than solutions :)

u6vhcp,"Youtube channel name is ermoon, video on how to get your brain to focus. You don't need subscribe or like, just see if you find the information useful. For those just want to read it, here are my notes. 

How to Get Your Brain to Focus

1. Why you can’t focus?

Why you can’t focus is because you never trained your brain to focus. If you’ve never lifted weights before you can’t expect yourself to lift 300 pounds. You need to train to be able to lift that weight. Similarly, you can’t expect yourself to focus if you’ve never trained your brain to do so.

1. Your brain is weak.

Modern world is full of distractions. So you rarely use your brain to focus, always distracted by your phone, games or social media. Imagine a person that doesn't work out and eats junk food all the time. He never uses his body, so the body adapts and becomes weak and fat. If you never use your brain to focus, it adapts and it never strengthens the part of your brain that is used for focus. As a result your brain is weak and you can’t focus.

1. How to improve your focus?

To become stronger you lift weights. To improve your skills to focus, you do things that require focus and learn to ignore distractions. When you sit down to work, your mind can’t focus, it gets distracted by thoughts about your phone, social media, food, anything that gives you instant pleasure. Now this is the difficult but also the most important part, you need to ignore the distractions and bring your focus back to work. This is really painful to do. But it’s supposed to be painful. The pain you feel when trying to focus is similar to the pain you feel when working out.  The pain is improving your skills to focus. Every time you ignore distractions and force yourself to focus, you are working out the part of your brain that is used for focus and it should be difficult. With each painful repetition and self-discipline, you are strengthening your skills to focus.

1. People that can focus intensely

The people that can focus intensely are the people that enjoy the painful process of focus. Just like the people that love working out, enjoy the pain of working out, because they understand that every painful repetition that they do is making them stronger and if you have done something difficult before, you know how good effort can feel sometimes, specially if you are working towards a goal that is important to you. The feeling of being productive, working with deep focus and getting stuff done feels amazing. So when it’s hard to focus and you keep getting distracted, enjoy that struggle and just keep bringing your focus back.

1. Find work that feels like play

You can get your brain to focus much easier when you like what you are doing. Find work that feels like play to you but work to other people. Then no one can compete with you. Because when their working for 16 hours a day you are playing for 16 hours a day. How you can find work that feels like play  is by revisiting your childhood memories, what got you excited when you were a little kid. If you liked sci-fi movies and rockets try learning about aerospace engineering on the internet and see if you like that. If you don’t like it, try learning something else. What other jobs look fun to you, then learn about that subject, does it make you excited to learn more? If not, try something else and just keep looking. It’s a trial and error process.

1. How long your brain can focus?

You can focus intensely for about 90 minutes in one session after that you’re brain is done. Make sure you know exactly what you need to work on before the focus session, During the session don’t let anything distract you, put your phone away, lock your room, I listen to nature sounds to cancel out noises. Get done as much as possible without any distractions until you feel like you can’t focus anymore.

1. Focus without rest is counter productive

Workout session is only effective with rest afterwards. If you lift weights non-stop for hours you get injured. Your brain can handle 1-3 90 minute focus sessions a day. In between those sessions, let your brain rest by doing simple tasks like walking, biking or cleaning. I highly recommend walking outside since it’s backed by a lot solid research. Just let your brain relax by essentially doing nothing. Stimulating your brain with social media or video games doesn't count relaxing, you can do that later on in the day.

1. You can focus in the first 8 hours of the day

If you had good quality sleep, you have a lot willpower in the first 8 hours of the day. Two hours after waking up is the most productive hours for humans naturally. You can schedule your first focus session two hours after waking. I usually wake up around 8 AM, think about what I’m going to work on during the focus session, drink my coffee and work until I can’t focus anymore. Then relax by taking a walk outside or hitting the gym.

1. Do not waste your productive hours

Do not waste your productive first 8 hours, it’s much easier to focus and have discipline during that time so do the things that are important to you while you have the mental energy.

1. No self-discipline later in the day naturally

After that it’s really difficult to focus and stay disciplined. Your body naturally lowers adrenaline, increases serotonin. This is why it gets difficult to stay disciplined later on the day and you can let loose little bit and procrastinate. I watch youtube most of the time. 

1. Difficult to focus after eating. Intermediate fasting

It’s also difficult to focus after eating a large meal specially carb and sugar heavy meal. Drinking coffee will lower your food appetite, drink salted water to stay hydrated and you won’t feel hungry in the first hours of the day. You can focus much better while fasting because once you eat a large meal you are done for the day, it’s hard to stay sharp after that. So I try to fast in the first 8 hours of the day, stay sharp mentally and do my work. Also the fasting has a lot added benefits for your health.

1. Boost brain performance during focus by resting

During focus sessions take few seconds of rest and literally do nothing, your brain learns faster and performs better when you rest in between. If you are learning to play the piano while learning take few seconds of break and just do nothing, stare to the window, walk around your room then get back to learning. This is similar to resting in between your workout sets. You push yourself close to failure while lifting take a break then you do another set. While focusing you will also feel your brain getting tired, that’s when you take a few seconds of break and do nothing. Don’t use this as an excuse to get distracted by your phone.

1. Where I took Ideas from

All the studies to support claims made here I took from stanford neuroscience professor Andrew Huberman's podcast on the episode on focus. Also stole ideas from Naval Ravikant Almanack book, and The Daily laws from Robert Greene.",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] How to get your brain to focus, no bullshit guide.

sziwo3,"If you start reading ‘how-to’ books (self-help, business, health and wellbeing), you’ll quickly notice the same ideas coming up again and again.

This is part of their value - hearing the same ideas expressed in new ways helps to enrich our understanding of them and spot their application in new contexts.

One idea that frequently comes up is ‘the pareto principle’ or 80/20 rule:

**Across many different areas, 80% of the results usually come from only 20% of the inputs.**

* 20% of posts generate 80% of traffic
* 20% of employees are responsible for 80% of the results
* 20% of drivers cause 80% of all traffic accidents

Really, the numbers aren’t important; what’s important is the underlying idea: ***some inputs are better than others***. This is the key. Once you recognise this, you can start to finetune your attention; you can begin to look for those more lucrative inputs.

Here’s how I like to think about it:

**Film director Woody Allen once said that 80% of success is just showing up.**

That means 80% of success is just arriving at the gym, opening that book, grabbing that pen and paper, picking up that instrument, introducing yourself to that person, whatever the case may be.

**There are no results without work on our part and the easiest way to start putting in the work is to start showing up.**

If we can internalise this, we actually make showing up easier. *We don’t need to have the perfect workout, we just need to get to the gym.* As a result, we make showing up more likely. We make achieving our goals more likely.

Don’t overthink the process. Whatever it is that you’re trying to do, just show up. Put in the reps, make time for it. As time goes on you’ll be able to see where your approach could be improved.

EDIT:

Take the time to think about one area in your life where you're setting the bar too high. It can be easy to think that high standards lead to better results, but if they’re stopping you from showing up… they’re not helping.

Maybe it's a workout/study routine that takes too much energy, an alarm clock set too early that you continuously snooze, or a meditation routine you gave up on. Whatever it is, consider how you could make it easier (less demanding) and give it another go.",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] Remember that 20% of success is just showing up.

n5e50h,"So, the fact is we simply can't stay motivated all the time 24/7. Motivation comes and goes, we will always have days when we just don't feel really productive and just want to sit around and watch Netflix or browse through Instagram.

What I found works much better for me is discipline. Motivation is making yourself ""feel like"" doing something while discipline is doing that thing whether you feel like it or not. 

The way I see it, there are 2 things to look out for when trying to be more productive:

First, I tried to find a way to stop procrastinating all the time and actually get to work on doing the things that are important to me. The second thing is staying disciplined and determined enough to keep that going for a longer period of time. 

If we were able to stop procrastinating and become disciplined only for a month, we would start building a habit and it would get easier every day. Once the habits is build through discipline it becomes much much easier to keep doing the thing we have to do without much need for motivation.

[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/VjadUOTt5p8) on some tactics I used to keep me from procrastinating and to keep me disciplined long enough to start forming that long-term habit.

The process of loving yourself can be extremely difficult. Especially if you don’t know what steps to take. A lot of people have a lot of varying opinions on what constitutes as self-love, and an overwhelming majority of these suggestions aren’t *wrong*. They’re just missing some steps.

&nbsp;

Normally, when you talk about self-love, and ask people how to implement it into your own life, they’ll say things like:

&nbsp;

- You should start working out more.

- You should start changing your diet and eating healthier.

- You should start doing things you enjoy.

- You should start spending time with friends.

- You should start mediating.

- You should start doing “X” activity.

&nbsp;

These suggestions aren’t wrong. They’ve helped many people develop and improve themselves, but they don’t address the full problem with self-love. I only ever mainly see suggestions that solve the physical aspect of loving yourself. And while I love the fact that people are sharing their experiences with loving themselves more, I feel the other aspects should be given the same exposure. 

&nbsp;

**Mental Self Love | Emotional Self Love | Physical Self Love | Spiritual Self Love**

&nbsp;

So, with that said, let’s get this started. 

&nbsp;
____

&nbsp;

**Why People Don’t Love Themselves, Mentally**

&nbsp;

Everything starts in the mind. If you don’t know how to utilize your mind, your thoughts, and develop it for self-love, it doesn’t matter what changes you try to make for yourself, what methods you try to implement into your life, you’ll fail. Your mindset is the starting point to any significant change in life.

&nbsp;

The problem with a lot of mindsets, is they’re usually traumatized at a young age. People go through tough shit. They face unyielding forms of physical, mental, emotional, and psychological abuse. And going through that abuse, on a consistent basis shapes their personal beliefs of self, their mindset. 

&nbsp;

- They were bullied in school. 

- They were abused by emotionally distant and inattentive 
parents. 

- They weren’t encouraged enough.

- They weren’t given the chance to express themselves.

- They faced excruciating failure. 

&nbsp;

Now, a lot of people go through these things in life, and sometimes, they come out the other side well-adjusted and *normal*. They’re able to overcome the overwhelming odds, and find success in their lives. Not just financial or career success, but relationship, personal, and social success. But for others, it isn’t that easy. And I don’t think people understand why that’s the case.

&nbsp;

For those who went through their personal circumstances, and don’t come out the other end well-adjusted and normal, it isn’t because they aren’t trying. It isn’t because they’ve given up. It isn’t because they don’t care about their own improvement and development. It isn’t because they’re unreachable.

&nbsp;

In one way or another, they grew up in an environment that constantly made them feel like they weren’t enough. 

&nbsp;

Like their needs didn’t matter. Like their opinions weren’t important. Like their values weren’t worth attention. Like their goals weren’t achievable. Like their happiness wasn’t a factor. 

&nbsp;

These negative perspectives were hammered into them, either through repetition through people they didn’t know, like strangers, or classmates. Or powerfully implemented by those they cared for most, and who’s opinions they held highest, like their parents, friends, teachers.

&nbsp;

And unlike those who did come out healthy and stable, they didn’t receive the positive reinforcement necessary to counteract all those negative perspectives. 

&nbsp;

- For every “You’re ugly.” They didn’t get a “You’re beautiful.”

- For every “You’re stupid.” They didn’t get a “You’re smart.”

- For every “You’re weird.” They didn’t get a “You’re amazing.”

- For every “You’re boring.” They didn’t get a “You’re interesting.”

- For every “Be quiet, shut up.”  They didn’t get a “Talk to me, I’ll listen.”

- For every “I’m busy, get out my face.” They didn’t get a “I love you so much.”

&nbsp;

So, you end up with adults with dangerously negative beliefs of themselves. Created from constant reminders they experienced through life. 

&nbsp;

- *”I’ll never achieve my goals. I’m not meant to succeed.”*

- *”I’ll never be in a relationship. I’m not attractive enough.”*

- *”I’ don’t have anything to offer anyone. I’m worthless.”*

- *”I always screw shit up. I’m so stupid.”*

- *”I’ll never be happy. Everybody hates me.”*

- *”There’s nothing worth loving about me. I should just die.”*

&nbsp;

For people with these types of beliefs, *this* is normal. Thinking of themselves in this way, having these perspectives of themselves, it’s all they’ve ever known. It’s all that was told to them. By people they cared about, people they valued, and strangers alike. 

&nbsp;

These thoughts aren’t their own. They aren’t true. But they are the opinions and suggestions of people they valued throughout life. They were opinions and suggestions that were expressed so often, that over time, their minds accepted them, and adopted them all as personal beliefs. 

&nbsp;

The first step in helping people heal their minds isn’t to immediately give them solutions like “Just think happy thoughts.”, “Just think positively.”, “Stop being so negative!” These are valid suggestions, in themselves, but prematurely given. First, before giving suggestions of solutions, you need to understand where they’re coming from. Where their mindsets came from, and why they truly believe all the toxic shit they tell themselves.

&nbsp;

Understand them first. Then, it’s safe to move on to solutions.

&nbsp;

**How to Love Yourself Mentally**

&nbsp;

There are 3 main principles that need to be understood when it comes to loving yourself mentally.

&nbsp;

**Step 1 | Understand it isn’t Your Fault**

&nbsp;

The abuse you went through wasn’t fair. You didn’t ask to be placed into the circumstances you were forced to experience. The damage that was applied over time, none of it was fair. None of it was deserved. None of it was justified.

&nbsp;

But it wasn’t your fault.

&nbsp;

This will be the hardest part for some people, only because their personal beliefs are already so set on self-dejection. They’ve accepted the bullshit they were fed. But as someone who went through some traumatic shit, I’m here to tell you, it isn’t your fault.

&nbsp;

One of the hardest truths I ever had to accept, was understanding *why* it wasn’t my fault. I always had examples for why I deserved the abuse I went through as a child. The bullying, the physical abuse, the mental abuse, the emotional abuse, I had a reason for why I deserved it all.

&nbsp;

- I got bad grades in school. My parents were right to punish me the way they did.

- I had huge eyebrows. What else were they going to tease me about?

- I never talked to anyone. Of course I’m the weird and quiet kid.

- I didn’t do what they told me to do fast enough. I should have moved faster.

- My interests are boring. No wonder nobody likes talking to me. 

&nbsp;

But deep down, these were only excuses I used to rationalize the abuse I received. The truth, when I finally figured it out, was much more relieving and liberating, but also scary.

&nbsp;

People will only ever treat you the way they know how to treat themselves. Meaning, people’s personalities and actions towards others, are shaped by their own experiences and mindsets. This was difficult to accept at first for me, because again, I already had my excuses lines up and ready to fire whenever abuse needed justification.

&nbsp;

But as I began to learn about the people in my life, those who caused me pain, the more this truth rang true. 

&nbsp;

My parents, primarily my father, wasn’t the way he was towards me because he hated me, or because he didn’t value me as his son. It was because his own father treated him the way he treated me, and he never received the positive reinforcement I so desperately wanted from him. He never learned to be better.

&nbsp;

My childhood bully didn’t bully me because my eyebrows were the bane of his existence, and he needed to get a jab in each day to remain sane. It was because at home, his single mother and siblings would treat him like shit because of their own circumstances. So, his only outlet was releasing that pent-up resentment on someone easy, someone who wouldn’t retaliate and act on his abuse.

&nbsp;

The random rude and unnecessary remarks by strangers I didn’t even know weren’t remarks based off my own character, my own value. They were based on the fact that their lives weren’t going well for them, and they didn’t know how to cope with their own struggles. So, they threw their negativity at me, because they were hoping it’d make them feel better.

&nbsp;

When I finally accepted this, and realized through talking to people, that it was indeed true, it became easy to forgive people. To understand them. And most importantly, to take back control of my own mental image, and work on improving my personal perspective.

&nbsp;

If you'd like to prove this idea for yourself, ask anyone who's hurt you in the past, about their childhood. About their experiences growing up. About any pain they've gone through. Chances are if you get them to open up, you'll realize why they are the way they are.",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] Self-Love Saga: How to Love Yourself Mentally,1715,0.99

____

&nbsp;

I’m 23 years old.

&nbsp;

I’ve read a lot of self-help books. Almost 100 over the past 3 years. I’ve learned a lot of methods and tactics to overcoming a plethora of issues and insecurities. I know how to overcome alcohol, drug, and porn addictions. I know how to lose and gain weight. I know how cultivate a healthier diet. I know how to interact with men and women, and pick up on signs of interest and attraction. I know how to develop and improve one’s charisma, confidence, and self-esteem. I know the importance of mental and emotional health, and how to develop them for a fulfilling life.

&nbsp;

I know a lot of shit.

&nbsp;

However, for the longest time, I struggled with implementing everything I knew and learned about. With each new book I’d complete, I’d be more knowledgeable and confident about life, and how to totally kick its ass. But when it came to actually implementing the steps I knew to do:

&nbsp;

- Earning money in any career path.

- Building romantic relationships with amazing women.

- Being social and holding conversations with people.

- Working out and developing my body.

- Increasing my confidence and self-expression.

&nbsp;

I’d always stop at some point. Without fail. I could go for days, or even weeks at a time trying to cultivate strategies and methods I’d read from numerous books. And for the most part, the things I was trying to implement could only benefit my life and make it better. Yet, I constantly struggled with sticking with anything long enough to make it a habit. I’d always go back to my old habits. I’d stop working out. I’d stop eating healthy. I’d succumb to my addictions. I’d get self-conscious talking to women again. I’d close myself off. I’d stop progressing.

&nbsp;

Then, I’d sulk. I’d spent the weekends laying in bed wallowing in self-pity and depression. Wondering why I could never change. Thinking about how it didn’t make sense. I read all these informative books, and resonate and even agree with most of the points made. I try and do the practices, the methods, the exercises I read, and every time, I revert back to my same old self. 

&nbsp;

It didn’t make sense.

&nbsp;

How could I continue to fail so often, when I held all this knowledge? When I *knew* what to do, how to act, and essentially just needed to go through the motions in order to succeed? 

&nbsp;

It was this point, at age 21, that I began to hate self-help books. I began to believe they were all scams, used to get money out of the poor and less fortunate, the less informed. They were just used to sell people dreams and hope of change, but never actually sharing with them the *actual* solutions to permanent change.

&nbsp;

I continued reading though, because at that point, I was addicted. While I hated the books, I was still silently hopeful that if I could just find that *one* book, I’d find the answers I was looking for. I didn’t bother implementing what I learnt though. I figured it was a waste of time. I’d just revert back to my old habits after a few weeks. I wasn’t meant for change. I wasn’t meant for success. I wasn’t meant to be in a happy relationship. I wasn’t meant to have the life I wanted. I was just meant to exist. To be average. To live, and die. Looking at all the people who’ve succeeded, knowing they had the answers, but chose to feed us bullshit to take our money.

&nbsp;

I truly believed that.

&nbsp;

Until one day, while I was driving to work, I listened to a speech on YouTube. The speech was called, *The Strangest Secret*, and it was from a guy named Earl Nightingale. The ideas behind the speech were from this book, *As a Man Thinketh*, by James Allen.

&nbsp;

The summary of the speech, and the book, were that man can’t change anything in his life, without first changing his mindset, perception, and attitude towards life. Before man can expect to make any significant changes in his life, he must first believe he can do so. He must see his goals, his dreams, in his imagination. Live as if they’re already a reality, and he only needs to wait for them to come to him. Reflecting over his dreams, his goals, every single day, in order to remain focused and disciplined.

&nbsp;

A lot of Law of Attraction stuff, basically. And LoA was highly prevalent in many self-help books, so while the speech was pretty good, I’ll admit, I assumed it was more bullshit. A lot of people who advocated for LoA seemed to believe that all you have to do is *believe* you’ll be successful, and you will! No mention of the actual steps necessary to achieve said success, just believe you’ll succeed, and you will! It just felt like more *hope* being sold for profit.

&nbsp;

But that speech stayed in my mind for the reminder of the day. And after I got home, I continued reading one of my *many* self-help books, and almost like a slap to the face, I realized something.

&nbsp;

This book was saying the same thing. Fundamentally, though worded differently. The beginning chapters spoke of believing in yourself and reflecting over your goals in order to achieve them. *You have to believe in yourself, and believe you’re capable of achieving X, first.*

&nbsp;

After finishing that book, I picked up another, and realized in the middle chapters of *this* book, were the same principles on belief. They had the same message. I started freaking out, and grabbed a handful of self-help books from my shelf, and found the *exact same* message in all of them, again, just worded differently, depending on the author.

&nbsp;

*This is it*, I thought. This is how they’re making their money. They all sell the same shit to people, just worded differently. I had books published all the way from the 1900’s, to present day 2019, and they all had the same fundamental message on achieving success in any capacity in life.

&nbsp;

You must believe, and develop faith in your mind first, before you can do anything. Surely this had to be some huge gimmick conspiracy. Or authors simply read the same books I had, and took the information that sounded good, and copy it into their own books. It isn’t as simple as *believing in yourself*. It can’t be. That’s too easy.

&nbsp;

But then I started branching out. I thought if I looked into financial books, biographies of business tycoons, the super-rich, surely, they’d say something different. Surely, they’d have some scientific and logical explanation for how they reached their levels of success. 

&nbsp;

I looked up guys as old as John Rockefeller, Edward Doheny, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford. I looked up present day business tycoons, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos, Oprah, Zuckerberg. I even looked up rappers, actors, comedians, and entertainers. Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Tom Cruz, George Clooney, Denzel Washington. I looked for as many motivational speeches and books from as many recognized *rich* people as I could. People that seemingly had no connection to one another what so ever.

&nbsp;

They all said the same exact shit at one point or another.

&nbsp;

- I ate, slept, and dreamt of this moment.

- I told myself everyday that I’d achieve X success.

- I wrote down my goals every single day.

- I always imagined what my success would look like.

- I told myself I was successful, and eventually I came true.

&nbsp;

Of course, there was hard work and persistence present in all these people, but *all* of them said it started with their mindset and believing in themselves.

&nbsp;

My perception of reality broke.

&nbsp;

So, I tried it.

&nbsp;

I said fuck it. If 100+ people all keep saying the same thing, and they all live lives better than mine, they must know something I don't, I'll give their way a shot.

&nbsp;

Instead of trying some new method or practice of discipline, or trying to follow some new routine that would get me rich, ripped, friends, a girlfriend, and confidence by the truck loads, I decided to scrap everything, and just focus on my mindset.

&nbsp;

Every day, twice a day, I'd reflect over my goals, and what I wanted for my life. I'd reflect over them twice a day, once in the morning, and once at night. After reflecting, I'd close my eyes for 10 minutes, and imagine my life with my new amazing body. With my bombshell girlfriend/wife. With all the money I wanted. With all the confidence and self-esteem, I could muster. With all the success I could envision.

&nbsp;

After that, I went about my day.

&nbsp;

I continued life as normal. Not taking any actual action towards improving my circumstances. Because, apparently, I had to believe I could first, otherwise nothing would change for long. 

&nbsp;

Well, after a week of these mental exercises, some really weird shit started happening.

&nbsp;

I started thinking about my life more. I started looking at my life, and wondering why I wasn't where I wanted to be. Soon, during my free time, I'd imagine more, visualize more, and the imagination practice I did started to become more vivid and real. I'd start to actually see the images I imagined in my head. And as I began to see them more clearly, I began to fill in more of the details that I before just left up in the air.

&nbsp;

I specified *how* I got the body I saw. *How* I got the women I was seeing. *How* I got the money I was spending. *How* I grew my confidence and self-esteem I was flaunting off. 

&nbsp;

And after specifying how I got those things in my imagination, I began  creating actual plans I could implement in my real life. Baby steps I could take, each day, to achieve the things I was seeing in my imagination.

&nbsp;

I noticed my internal dialog was more positive and encouraging. No longer as negative and dismissive like it used to be in the past. I realized that one day, while thinking about actually taking action towards one of the blueprints I had written out, instead of my mind telling me, ""Nah bro, that's shit won't work. There's no point."" it said, ""What are you waiting for? Let's go."" **And I actually started working!**

in1mqi,"Stop relying on discipline a.k.a “Willpower” and leverage your chimp mind and brain patterns to do the things you want to do. You simply are going to do — endlessly —whatever your dopamine triggers are attached to. 

It’s not willpower, it’s not thinking about your goals, it’s not doing breathing exercises. Although all these may push you take take action they’re much much more inefficient compared to modifying your environment and strategically linking your dopamine triggers to the things you want to do. 

Make the things you need/want to do easy. Humans always take the path of least resistance. When you change your environment your able to change where the path of least resistance goes. Discipline is less so an act of willpower but more so an act of making the things important to you easy to do. In terms of behavior in this aspect we all are very simple little dumb creatures and all you need are little treats and at the end of that your logical goal. 

I know hate may come but don’t be misled, there are so many things that can get people to take action. Pressure, accountability, belief, identity, negative and positive reinforcement, tips and tricks, etc. And they all have a place. But learning how your brain fundamentally chooses what your next move is is foundational to learning how to take advantage of it to actually accomplish the things you want to do and it’s going to be the biggest driving factor to you taking action in the long term assuming you’re not in a system of discipline.

nohikx,"Some people might argue that a productive day is a day when you get a lot of things done. While that might be true, getting a lot of things done isn't necessarily productive. It all depends on the value of the things you got done.

Productivity isn't about getting things done. It's about getting the right things done.

If you're a writer, then baking 50 breads in one day isn't really productive.   
If you're a baker, then writing 50 pages in one day also isn't really productive.

So how do you decide what the right things are for you?

Well, first you'd have to know what it is that you're trying to achieve.

But if you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there.

Without clarity, you’ll just find stuff to stay busy.

Really successful business, sports or whatever people start with the end in mind. They know exactly where they want to go so they can make strategic decisions about how to get there.

Only then can they increase their impact by maximizing time spent on those high-value activities.

You could summarize it like this:

Purpose drives priority. Priority drives action. Action drives results.

If you can connect your actions to your purpose, you can directly and dramatically improve your results.

# Starting with the end in mind is something we do all the time.

**For example, let’s think back to the last time you planned a vacation.**   


What did you do before you went on that travel?

*First, you made a picture in your mind of what that vacation should look like.* Maybe you pictured a sunny climate and a tropical beach, mountain hiking with your family, or visiting the best pubs in famous towns with a bunch of friends.

*Then, you found a destination that met those criteria.* Maybe this meant that you would go to Thailand, the Alps of Switzerland, or cityhopping in Ireland.

*Next, you thought about logistics and preparation.* What‘s the best way to get to your destination? What does it cost? How long will I go? What do I need?

*Then you started preparing.* You bought plane tickets, packed your bags, and asked your mother-in-law to feed the cat.

*Only then you left to go on your journey.*

**Now when we leave out steps or mix up the order, things may not run so smoothly.**

o If you leave out logistics and preparation, you may never reach your dreamed-of destination. o If you don’t use criteria for where to go, you may end up someplace you really dislike. o And if you don’t ask your mother-in-law to feed the cat, the cat may die in your absence.

**Unfortunately this is how many people approach their lives and careers.**

If you don’t have a clear vision of where you’re going, everything seems equally urgent and important. You might get things done, but it drains you and you’re not making the impact you‘re hoping for. Or you might NOT get things done at all, lacking real motivation to take action.

This isn’t how we want to do it.

By following the same natural process we use when planning our travel, we can take back control of our time, double our impact at work, increase our satisfaction in life and even free up personal time in the process.

# Step 1. What does success look like for me?

Many great entrepreneurs start with the end in mind. They believe the future can be better than the present and that they have the power to make it so.

Maybe success for you means scaling your business, climbing the career ladder or doubling your income. But it could also be things like getting in the best physical shape of your life, or having a GREAT work-life balance. Or all of those things together.

Whatever it is for you, you HAVE to know it.

Start by picturing success in your mind. Make it awe-inspiring. Think big and unrestricted. Don’t ask how. Be specific. The more detailed the picture, the better. And write it down!

Again, it is very important to get this right. If you know exactly where you want to go and what matters most, you‘ll have a Bright Star to guide you. Now you can be strategic about the decisions you’re making in life AND business. And make the best use of your time, which is the foundation of productivity.

*So what would YOUR life or career have to look like some years from now for you to be ultimately happy?*

# Step 2. Why do I want that?

Knowing why you’re doing what you’re doing makes your goals compelling. If you clearly picture a better future that excites you, the vision starts pulling you towards it, boosting your motivation and energy and making it easier for you to be successful.

Answer at least one of the following 2 questions:

o What positive effect would realizing your vision have on you and the people around you? o How will your achievements make the world a better place with happier people?

# Step 3. What are my 3-5 big moves/steps?

If your purpose can be compared to the destination of your journey, this is the journey itself. In other words: what rough 3-5 steps are needed to get from point A to point B?

For example, if your purpose is to be a New York Times bestselling author, your 3 big steps could be: o Writing a book o Getting it published o Promoting it

What 3-5 big steps will take you from point A to point B?

# Step 4. How can I overcome my obstacles?

**Looking at what’s needed to get from point A to point B, what obstacles are in the way?**

Write down all of your obstacles:

o Do you lack certain skills or knowledge? o Do you have enough time, money and energy? o Do you have the necessary materials? o Do you need a team?

**Looking at your list of obstacles, what can you do to overcome or prevent them?**

Successful people never say I CAN’T. Instead, they ask HOW CAN I?

# Step 5. What is my timeline?

Create specific (SMART) goals and milestones. Estimate time and create a timeline so you can track your progress.

# Step 6. What’s the next step now?

Based on your big-scale plan, goals and milestones, what’s the very next step that should be taken action on?

Go ahead and do that NOW! Theory doesn't bring results.

# A final word

Remember, productivity isn’t about getting things done. It’s about getting the RIGHT things done efficiently. And if you’ve read this far, you should already have a better understanding of what those right things are for you.

Most people don’t know the answers to all of these questions perfectly right away, and that’s okay.

There is one habit that you need to focus on to change your life, and it's not these fab habits that you see the self help gurus talking about.

It's not cold showers.

It's not waking up at 4:00am to check off 74 things on your morning routine to do list.

It's not meditation.

It's not affirmations.

But none of them are as powerful as this one.

To follow through to your word, to yourself.

l5b3lz,"As the title suggests I will explain what has worked for me in being able to develop self-discipline in my daily routines

When I first started on my self improvement journey I would try and build many habits in my life but the mistake I made was that I focused solely on motivation to try and maintain my habits. Motivation is an unreliable source of fuel as it is external and comes and goes at random which you have 0 control over, and because of this none of the habits I tried to form ever stuck with me long enough to become actual habits. 

Fast forward a year and I finally realised that what I needed to focus on was not motivation but building discipline as having strong discipline will allow you to complete any task necessary no matter your emotional state at that current moment in time. As for how to actually build discipline from scratch, what I did and would recommend anyone new to this to do is to start off with the smallest task that you find uncomfortable to do. For me making my bed every morning was something I found uncomfortable to do so I started off by completing that single task every day. The important thing to know is discipline is like a muscle and the more you use it the stronger it grows and it is something that absolutely can be trained. After making my bed became a routine to me, I took one step up and moved onto completing a daily task that was a little bit more challenging and uncomfortable, which for me was taking a shower with lukewarm water. Again, once I got comfortable with this I took another stair up and challenged myself to more uncomfortable tasks. I repeated this process of pushing myself into discomfort a little bit at a time until I was able to form many habits which actually stuck with me. 

I know how daunting and hard building discipline can be for new people on this journey but just remember, getting better at anything in life is all about marginal improvements and these small steps will eventually lead to extraordinary results to the point where you look back at yourself and won't be able to recognise the person you were before. Think of building discipline as a game, every time you use discipline by saying no to temptation and urges or you complete the task you need to get done but didn't want to, you become just a little bit more disciplined than before. I would also like to add that running, to me was the ultimate exercise for building discipline. This is because during a run there is no such thing as stopping or rest and it is a constant mental battle with your mind telling you to stop since you are tired, so finishing a run is something that naturally requires a tremendous amount of discipline and this discipline that you can acquire from running will be applicable to any task in life.

m9o9lj,"Something I’ve realised through this journey of battling my depression and anxiety and reading a million self help books and taking therapy and trying to get my life back on track in terms of taking action and being disciplined - is that... I’ll always have to push myself. It’ll never come easily. Taking that action, doing the things I know I should do... It just won’t magically ever happen. Nobody’s coming to save me, nobody’s coming to pull me out of my negative emotions and inaction, and nobody’s coming to pick me and change my life! 

It’s only me who has the capability to the take intentional steps. Even the step to, let’s say, reach out and take therapy - that’s on me. Asking for that help is on me, reaching out is on me, communicating is on me, and taking action is on me. 

I think for the longest time - I kept waiting to feel motivated and excited about certain things. I wouldn’t do them because I didn’t feel like doing them. I thought this was an okay justification. But my therapist talked to me about Behavioral Activation as a way to help depression and I’ve also heard of the power of action through many motivational self-help speakers like Mel Robbins.  As Mel says - “You KNOW what to do... but you don’t do it... because you’re all too busy waiting to FEEL like it!” 

What I’ve realised is that I’ll never really “feel” like doing the things I need to do. Waking up on time? Getting out of bed immediately? Going for that walk? Joining that fitness class? Making that plan with my friend? I’ll never always “feel” like doing it. But if I keep giving into my negative feelings which always want to isolate me and have unhealthy habits - then I’ll sink further into those feelings and it’ll get worse. 

What I need to do is push myself to take action in-spite of my feelings - in-spite of my desire to not do it, in-spite my fear of rejection, in-spite of my insecurities. I’m human. I’ll feel fear. I’ll feel demotivated. I’ll feel exhausted. Do I absolutely to need to always act according to that fear? Actually, not at all... 

Recently I’ve been acting according to things I know I should do, while still experiencing that demotivation or fear - because I’ve understood that nobody’s coming to save me and that I don’t really need to give into my feelings. My brain is trying to keep me in its comfort zone. I can choose to step out. After the initial discomfort and pain - I’ve truly seen how my life has changed for the better. It’s helping my depression so much! 

It’s all about taking that action before your brain talks you out of it. 

We can’t always (directly and magically) change what we feel but we can act at the level of behavior because our behavior can definitely bring about a change in feeling. 

Things take effort. I’ll always have to push myself. There’s no magical way out. But as I keep pushing myself, as I keep noticing changes in my life... pushing myself will become easier. 

(I’ve also been using Mel Robbins’ 54321 trick to help do something when I really don’t want to, so I’d suggest checking her videos out on this topic.

mmsx43,"I'm going straight to the point and say this:

'Productivity is about doing something (anything) in a day and NOT about crunching as many things as possible in a day'

Here's the thing:

One thing you can notice from productivity videos is that they actually don't do a lot in a day, they don't study half a textbook from scratch in a day nor build a time-travelling machine within a week while mastering the arts of yo-yo and Minecraft. They just don't and yet, they have so much accomplished that you find yourself wanting to mirror.

So you decided to plan out an intense schedule to be able to mirror that productive person in an instant. Then you think 'why stop there when I can do more?' You then plan something more intense that could make the spawn of Elon Musk and Tony Stark's jaw drop. So you feel satisfied with your plan and sleep. Days later, you realise you actually did nothing at all and start to feel this hatred to yourself.

The problem is-- you want so many things in such a short amount of time that it starts to make you so overwhelmed and afraid that instead, you actually procrastinate. You become afraid of not being able to accomplish it all and disappoint yourself thus feeling all your plan go downhill. You become afraid of not being able to do other things you enjoy because all of it is filled with work.

And so, you do nothing or something else that you don't even like just so you can avoid it and this is even more disastrous.

So let me tell you this:

Take one step every day and not a million. Walk before you run. The mere task of simply walking itself is already being productive because, again, productivity is about doing something not doing everything.

You have all the time in the world as long as your body, your health permits it (because let's think about this-- it is going to such a waste of efforts if you plan out your whole life in every hour when you die a month later from stress).

You have all the time in the world you give yourself. That's all to it so take a deep breath and let this sink in.

There is no need to rush. You have all the time in the world. So take one step at a time and on every step is a single easy task and from there, let it build to something, to a path you feel happy in.

Additional point:

You are the one to do this task not your pet nor the president, but you. You are the one to accept consequences, not society (sure maybe it will affect them one way or another but everything affects everything it's a way of life). In the end, it's all up to you.

1i31bbq,"i’m a student with adhd who ranked 1st in my uni. how? because i stopped forcing myself into other people's systems. 

my secret:

* if you have to force yourself to care = don't try
* if the thought of not doing it hurts more than the struggle = do it

i didn’t make it up myself, it all came from drunk poets final message - don’t try.

at first i didn’t understand it. i thought its just an advice for depressed lazy people who don’t have any goals in life. but actually these two words changed my life.

here's the thing about overthinking:

* we spend hours watching tutorials instead of building
* we plan perfect routines we never follow
* we try to force ourselves to love things we hate

since i started living by this, everything changed:

* launched my first app with my best friend
* started traveling without overthinking every detail
* stopped doing things just because i ""should""

the less i tried to be something i am not, the more i actually got done.

wanna stop overthinking? stop trying to want things you don't actually want. stop trying to be someone you're not. do the things that feel natural, even when they're hard.

og7ph4,"I read in Atomic Habits that skipping a habit once is an accident, skipping twice is the start of a new habit. 

But what didn’t click for a while -and what changed everything for me when it finally did click- is that this means you can never skip today when thinking about your habits. Even if you don’t feel like it, you can’t skip today because you can’t guarantee that you won’t accidentally skip tomorrow. 

I used to often think “I’ll do it tomorrow” but now I realized that I have no idea if I’ll do it tomorrow or not. Tomorrow might be a weird and abnormal day, and I might not have the chance to do it then. Which means I have to do it right now, today, while I still can, even though I don’t feel like it. Because if I skip both today and tomorrow I’ve started a new habit of skipping. 

So I don’t skip today, no matter how inconvenient or how annoying it feels today, just in case I accidentally end up skipping tomorrow.

1l4vlph,"I spent a solid chunk of last year feeling like my brain is totally f*cked. My energy was none existent. So, I went full mad scientist on myself and researched like crazy, tried a ton of stuff, and actually figured out how to fix my my brain again

(There are sections, but honestly, it all kinda works together.)

---
LEVEL 1: Nail these first

● SLEEP: 
- Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. 

● HYDRATE: 
- Carry a water bottle. Drink it. All day. Headaches? Brain fog? Dehydration is a sneaky bastard.

●	SUNLIGHT: 
- 10-15 mins of morning sunlight (even through a window). Resets your internal clock. You can also get a light therapy lamp for dark winter days.

● MOVE YOUR DAMN BODY:
- Quick Walks: Clears the head, gets blood pumping.


Desk Stretches:
1.	Neck Tilts & Rotations
2.	Shoulder Rolls (Forward & Back): Release the hunch.
3.	Cat-Cow: Mobilize your spine.

*Seriously, 5 mins a few times a day makes a HUGE difference to blood flow and focus.*

● STAND UP MORE: 
- Sitting is brain-drain. Got a standing desk (better posture) and set timers to stand/stretch every few hours.

---
LEVEL 2: Things got really interesting for me.

- GET YOUR BLOOD CHECKED: Went to the doc, demanded comprehensive bloods. Low Vitamin D, B12, and borderline iron.

*Seriously, if you feel chronically shit, this is step one*

● FOOD INTOLERANCE:  
- Always had a weird stomach. Did a food intolerance test (get a decent one). Turns out, dairy and gluten were basically carpet-bombing my system with inflammation, making my brain feel like sh*t. 
If you gut is f*cked, your brain is fucked. 

● MOUTH BREATHING AT NIGHT: 
- Realized I was a mouth-breather in my sleep. Taped my mouth (sounds weird, look up ""mouth taping for sleep""). Sleep quality really improved

**Edit:**

If you think you might have sleep apnea, definitely consult your doctor before trying mouth taping, it could worsen the condition and, in rare cases, be life-threatening.

**Signs of sleep apnea to watch for:**

Loud, chronic snoring
Pauses in breathing during sleep
Excessive daytime sleepiness
Morning headaches
Waking up gasping or choking

---
LEVEL 3: Fix your brainrot

● COLD SHOWERS: 
- Started with 30 secs of cold at the end of my normal shower. Now up to 2 mins full cold. The energy you get from that is INSANE.

● GREEN TEA + L-THEANINE > COFFEE:
- Swapped my jitter coffee for green tea (or matcha) with an L-Theanine supplement. Clean, calm, focused energy. No 3 PM crackhead crash.

●	""DOPAMINE DETOX"" SUNDAYS (OR WHATEVER DAY):
- One day a week, minimal tech, minimal stimulation. Just be bored. First few weeks were actual hell. Now? My brain actually enjoys normal, non-hyper-stimulated life again.

● WIM HOF BREATHING: 
- 30 deep belly inhales, full exhales. After last exhale, hold breath (empty lungs) 1-2 mins. Deep inhale, hold 15-30 secs. Instant energy & clarity. Repeat 2-3x for full effect if you have time. 

**Edit:**
Wim Hof breathing isn’t recommended for people with high anxiety, since the intense sensations (like dizziness or rapid heartbeat) can trigger or worsen anxiety or panic. If that’s you, it’s better to start with gentler breathwork.

**Try this instead: Box Breathing (calming & safe):**

1. Inhale for 4 seconds

2. Hold your breath for 4 seconds

3. Exhale slowly for 4 seconds

4. Hold again for 4 seconds

Repeat for 2–5 minutes. It’s great for calming your nervous system and regaining control.



● CHEW GUM (WHEN YOU NEED TO FOCUS): 
- Sounds fake, but it surprisingly works for studying/deep work. Supposedly increases blood flow to the brain.

--- 
LEVEL 4: Fix Your Attention Span

● GRAYSCALE YOUR PHONE: 
- Best. Hack. Ever. Makes TikTok/Insta look as appealing as watching your granny undress. Zero desire to scroll.

● UNFOLLOW them: 
- Kept actual friends + maybe 5 accounts that actually teach me something. The rest? UNFOLLOW.

● APP BLOCKERS: 
- Blocked Reddit, Youtube etc. during focused work blocks.

● NOTIFICATIONS: OFF (MOSTLY): 
- Your brain doesn't need a damn ping every 5 seconds.

---
LEVEL 5: Supplements & Systems

● WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER: 
- Work in focused 90-minute blocks, then take a REAL 15-20 min break (walk, stretch, stare out the window, NO phone.

● MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE (BEFORE BED): 
- Helped with sleep quality and overall chillness.

● OMEGA-3s (FISH OIL/ALGAE OIL): 
- Brains are fatty. Feed 'em good fats.

---
THE MOST OVERLOOKED FIXES:

●	FIX. YOUR. POSTURE: 
- Seriously. Hunching kills blood flow to your brain and gives you neck ache. Get yourself a standing desk / Laptop stand + decent chair + consciously sitting/standing taller

● GET YOUR EYES CHECKED:
- Had a tiny vision issue I ignored. New glasses = headaches GONE by 90%. Less eye strain = less headache.

1e4kxv5,"**1. Meditate for a minute before starting any work.**

Focus on your breath.

Enjoy the sensations of being there, free of any pressure to perform.

Allow your mind to still like particles floating to the bottom of a jar of water.

From a place of calm, you have a crucial starter’s advantage.

Now you’re a freaking zen monk, and it’s not even 8am.

This is where creativity and energy flourish.

**2. Don't complain.**

Most of us are unproductive because we’re complaining to ourselves in the dim theatre of our minds about how ‘hard everything is.’

Stop whining, and stop moaning.

Find your inner badass who’s been standing there for close to a year sharpening his blade waiting for you to locate your nuts.

Bring that dude out and unleash the demons of hell.

**3. Decide to have fun.**

Most people freeze like frightened bunnies when it comes to ‘productivity’ because they view it as high pressure and kinda dull.

Productivity doesn’t have to be some heavy ‘discipline’ that takes effort.

All you need to do is figure out the next small step and find a way to enjoy it.

YOU bring the enjoyment. You can choose to be silly.

You’ll never outwork someone who’s enjoying themselves.

**4. Walk an hour a day.**

What?

Yes, spending time outdoors being ‘unproductive’ seems counterintuitive.

But most of us are low energy because we’re on our fat butts all day, and we allow our minds to grow thick with worry.

Walking clears all of this out, gets us into our bodies and multiplies our creativity.

If you want the secret ‘hack’ - walking is it (so is any movement).

**5. Free-write like a champion.**

Write anything that comes to mind for at least a minute.

Allow your fingers to perform a lap dance for you on the keyboard, and just have fun seeing what shows up.

**6. Leave your peepee alone.**

I get it - bouncy big boobs on the Internet give you a comforting rush that you can’t get anywhere else because Jane won’t respond to your texts.

But if you want to experience unparalleled creativity, you need to quit that shit and transmute your sex energy.

After a few days, you will be astounded at how powerful this is.

**7. Do ’the thing.’**

Do the thing you’ve been avoiding.

Clean the snowdrifts of dust from under your damn bed for a change.

Wash the dishes.

Do that ‘dull’ chore. It’s not hard; it just requires effort.

**8. Save the croissants for a Saturday.**

I see you. Shovelling that extra-large croissant into your mouth hole on a Tuesday morning at the cafe.

Then I continue watching (and judging you) as you scroll cute cats on Instagram - that article you were planning to write now a distant dream.

Treat yourself less, so you do and be more.

Drop the carby crap, and you’ll be light on your toes, brain firing, and ready to rock.

**9. Decide to be a warrior.**

There’s something incredibly enlightening about how a simple decision can alter reality right now.

Decide to be the most courageous, brutal, animal version of yourself.

**10. Rewrite IMMENSE goals daily.**

Most of us never reach our goals.

That’s ok. But most goals are boring as all hell.

The real, secret value of goals is the excitement they stir in you today.

Hitch a ride on this hack by rewriting exciting, mega goals once or even twice daily.

**11. Drink like an elephant.**

I don’t need to tell you what Sally in Biology class wouldn’t shut up about: we’re mostly made of water.

So drink up. Most of us are tired because we’re dehydrated.

**12. Triple down on the present moment.**

The ultimate productivity secret no one tells you is this: do one thing at a time, with full enjoyment and presence.

mo4pxd,"I don’t know if some variation of this is out there. But here is how i keep myself focused on my long term goals and deal with any pain in the present.

1. I close my eyes

2. Take a deep breath and pretend that I’m watching my life go by fast.
I have kids, they grow up, leave the nest, i grow older, loss of pets, loss of parents, unexpected tragedies, healthy problems and then I’m on my death bed surrounded by my partner, kids and grandkids. I imagine my whole life flash before my eyes while I’m about to die.

3. Then i slowly open my eyes and make myself believe that it all really happened and that i have somehow travelled back to my younger self’s body.

I know this sounds weird but if this was possible and you got a second chance at living your life you’d  what would you do differently ?

Will you accept that you can’t change things that aren’t in your control and work on those that are ? 
Because things that are meant to happen will still happen. You’ll still loose your loved ones. But atleast you can keep reminding yourself to soak in every moment spent with them.
There must be a million ways to motivate yourself but When i loose sight of the bigger picture and I’m struggling to keep up i think of how I need to make my older self prouder. How my actions today will define my future, how every missed opportunity will feel like.

n9fqw9,"I think in order for a person to grow to his or her full potential is to accept first the fact that were only HUMANS. 

In the age of social media we can only see the extremes of things. The goals achieved and the failures being laughed at. And as result,  it produces fear, anxiety, envy and doubt. It gives us the idea that we need only be successful in order to become accepted. Failure is not an option. Failure should not happen. And when natural things occur, the forces we cannot control, we tend to fear the humiliation and the embarassment of things because it doesnt fit in the social media mold. So we get depressed, we cower in our own little shell trying to subdue the emotion by feeding ourselves with entertainment. And it felt good. 

And in that, we hide rather than fail. 

But im not saying failure is fun, im not saying entertainment is bad. But how we try to run from failure is what makes us suffer more. Because we are not acting like HUMANS. 

TO FAIL IS HUMAN. 

And you should accept it first. You must agree to the terms of conditions of life that whatever you do, there are chances of failing. And its your choice to insert the coin to continue, or go to another game. But making mistakes, failing, being sad and frustrated is life saying we are still alive and human. 

Maybe all of us are trying too hard that we dont enjoy things anymore, because we havent accepted the fact that we can fail. And we cannot fail because thats what the media said to us, that is what our boss said to us, Thats what our parents said to us, thats what our teachers said to us, That is what our coaches said to us, that is what the society tells us. Failure is never an option.

But what if it is?

That its okay to make mistakes? That we fell short this round? That we will be better next time? Or its not working for me ill try something else?

To fail is life asking us questions. To fail is to show how determined we are to succeed. To fail is life own test on how strong we are. To fail is to know our priorities. To fail is to know our goals and set things straight. To fail is a reminder we are humans. 

When we accept that things can go wrong, things become lighter. Things become a bit easier. And when we accept that we can fail, we can now be sure what really matter to us.

1j85jw6,"For years I thought I was just lazy. ""I'll do it tomorrow"" was basically my life motto. I'd make plans, set goals, create elaborate systems and then... nothing.. at all. I'd watch another episode, scroll another hour, push everything to ""someday.""
But here's the truth I finally faced: I wasn't lazy. I just had no sense of urgency. 
I was living like I had infinite time. Like someday I'd magically have more motivation, more discipline, more willpower. So I kept waiting for that perfect moment when everything would click. 
Then one day it hit me: Time is the only resource you can never get back.
I realized I needed something to make this real. Not just another planner or habit tracker that I'd abandon in a week. I needed something that would constantly remind me: life is happening NOW.
So I did something simple but life-changing:
I started a 90-day countdown.
Not some vague ""I'll change my life someday"" BS. A literal, ""I have exactly 90 days to make progress"" countdown.
At first, I just crossed off days on a calendar. It was fine, but I needed something more in-my-face. Something I couldn't ignore.
So I built a simple countdown timer that appears on every new browser tab I open. Every. Single. Tab.
Each time I go to waste time online, I'm confronted with exactly how many days, hours, and minutes I have left in my 90-day challenge. It's impossible to ignore, impossible to forget.

The results? In just 30 days:
Finally finished that project I'd been ""about to start"" for 2 years
Consistently worked out 5x a week sometimes even 6 (after years of on-again-off-again gym memberships)
Started waking up at 6:30am without hitting snooze (a literal miracle for someone who used to need 5 alarms and still ends up waking at 9 and rushing to everything)

Here's what I've learned: You're not lazy. You're not broken. You're just like that overconfident rabbit who thinks the race is already won. You think you have all the time in the world.
You don't.
Life isn't about finding motivation. It's about creating urgency. It's about making yourself feel the countdown in your bones.
I'm not saying you need to use my exact system. Maybe for you it's something else. But whatever you do, find a way to make the passing of time REAL to you.
Because you don't have unlimited tomorrows. The clock is ticking whether you acknowledge it or not.
What would you accomplish if you truly felt the urgency of your one precious life?
Stop scrolling and start counting down.

Just remember you only have limited number of days and you can change the world in 90days.

2scdwz,"If you want to get anything done, there are two basic ways to get yourself to do it.

The first, more popular and devastatingly wrong option is to try to motivate yourself.

The second, somewhat unpopular and entirely correct choice is to cultivate discipline.

This is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes. Few uses of the term “paradigm shift” are actually legitimate, but this one is. It’s a lightbulb moment.

What’s the difference?

Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional state is necessary to complete a task.

That’s completely the wrong way around.

Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them.

The implications are huge.

Successful completion of tasks brings about the inner states that chronic procrastinators think they need to initiate tasks in the first place.

Put in simpler form, you don’t wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. You train to get into olympic form.

If action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. I know that too well, and wish somebody pointed it out for me twenty, fifteen or ten years ago before I learned the difference the hard way.

If you wait until you feel like doing stuff, you’re fucked . That’s precisely how the dreaded procrastinatory loops come about.

At its core, chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing things we feel like doing. The problem is then framed thus: “How do I get myself to feel like doing what I have rationally decided to do?”. Bad.

The proper question is “How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?”.

The point is to cut the link between feelings and actions, and do it anyway. You get to feel good and buzzed and energetic and eager afterwards.

Motivation has is the wrong way around. I am utterly 100% convinced that this faulty frame is the main driver of the “sitting about in underwear playing Xbox, and with yourself” epidemic currently sweeping developed countries.

There are psychological problems with relying on motivation as well.

Because real life in the real world occasionally requires people do things that nobody in their right mind can be massively enthusiastic about, “motivation” runs into the insurmountable obstacle of trying to elicit enthusiasm for things that objectively do not merit it. The only solution besides slackery, then, is to put people out of their right minds. That’s a horrible, and fortunately fallacious, dilemma.

Trying to drum up enthusiasm for fundamentally dull and soul crushing activities is literally a form of deliberate psychological self-harm, a voluntary insanity: “I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE SPREADSHEETS, I CAN’T WAIT TO FILL OUT THE EQUATION FOR FUTURE VALUE OF ANNUITY, I LOVE MY JOB SOOO MUCH!”

I do not consider self-inflicted episodes of hypomania the optimal driver of human activity. A thymic compensation via depressive episodes is inevitable, since the human brain will not tolerate abuse indefinitely. There are stops and safety valves. There are hormonal hangovers.

The worst thing that can happen is succeeding at the wrong thing – temporarily. A far superior scenario is retaining sanity, which unfortunately tends to be misinterpreted as moral failure: “I still don’t love my pointless paper-shuffling job, I must be doing something wrong.” “I still prefer cake to brocolli and can’t lose weight, maybe I’m just weak”. “I should buy another book about motivation”. Bullshit. The critical error is even approaching those issus in terms of motivation or lack thereof. The answer is discipline, not motivation.

There is another, practical problem with motivation. It has a tiny shelf life, and needs constant refreshing.

Motivation is like manually winding up a crank to deliver a burst of force. At best, it stores and converts energy to a particular purpose. There are situations where it is the correct attitude, one-offs where getting psyched and spring-loading a metric fuckton of mental energy upfront is the best course of action. Olympic races and prison breaks come to mind. But it is a horrible basis for regular day-to-day functioning, and anything like consistent long-term results.

By contrast, discipline is like an engine that, once kickstarted, actually supplies energy to the system.

Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.

In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.

You get to feel good afterwards.

Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.

How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop.

Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.

eoocr8,"Dear Community

First of all, the following points are based on my individual experience and will probably not be applicable to all people. Nevertheless, here is a selection of tips that have helped me to ""grow up"". All points are very simplified. If you want to know more, I am open for your questions.

I believe that a solid character makes it much easier to be / become disciplined.

&#x200B;

**1\] Take responsibility for your own actions**  
How should we gain self-discipline if we do not ultimately face the consequences for what we are responsible?

&#x200B;

**2\] Passion brings luck**  
Anyone who lives her/his passion for a topic acts energizing. Accordingly, people are much more willing to support you - and thus also to provide for your goals and happiness.

&#x200B;

**3\] ""We accept the love we think we deserve""**  
In other words: We have to manage to like ourselves before we are ready to be truly loved and to accept this.

&#x200B;

**4\] Compliments have influence**  
With small positive remarks about the people around you, you can not only improve other people's day, but also your own.

&#x200B;

**5\] Success is usually a combination of luck and hard work**  
Most success stories consist of both factors, not just one.

&#x200B;

**6\] Accepting help requires strength**  
And accepting it then helps you to become even stronger.

&#x200B;

**7\] We are more than just the ""abilities""**  
Our abilities form our foundation, but it is the decisions that really set us apart. Both ways, positive and negative.

&#x200B;

**8\] ""Do it with a smile or don't""**  
In other words: if you're going to do something, do it right. Most of the time, it gets you the farthest in life. Exceptions prove the rule.

&#x200B;

**9\] Nobody wins a marathon by walking three steps**  
And even the best runner had to learn how to walk as a child. Learn constantly, learn in small steps and the rest usually comes with time.

&#x200B;

**10\] Learn from mistakes.**  
Whether they are yours or other people's doesn't matter that much. Best if you learn of both, though.

&#x200B;

**11\] ""If you're going through hell, keep going""**  
A little quote from Winston Churchill. Uncommented.

jxejad,"My life is fucked up, I have no friends and I'm mentally unstable..

I watched my mom die when I was 16. I never had a relationship with my father. I was physically and mentally abused and neglected at home and at school. I was in an abusive relationship for 4 years. I was sexually assaulted in June when I was 20.

I'm a fucking loser. I just quit a job, got another and quit that. Next semester I will be a Junior but I feel like I will never make it. I'm a cell phone addict, Kratom addict, dependent on prescribed Xanax and truthfully everything that has happened to me has drove me fucking crazy. I had a nervous breakdown over the summer and drank a shit ton and fucked my life up.

I haven't drank in a month, deactivated my FB and plan to delete it completely in a few months, started going back to the gym, but I feel like it's too late.

jly5cn,"I am employed (for now), have decent amount of savings that if I stop earning, I can survive for 8-10 months easy. I have a job that takes literally less than 1-2 hours of my day.

Yet, I find myself spending all day just playing games, watching random shows and just wasting away time in my room. I don't think I've left the room for more than 3 hours in the past 2 weeks.

It's like I am avoiding real life and the consequences of trying to go after something greater.

I've been depressed/sad/lonely. All my friendships have faded away. I have no one to talk to.

I have gained roughly 60-70 pounds in the last year and my body is breaking down.

I recently started writing a blog, but the quality of my work is so bad that it just takes away all motivation. I want to be an entrepreneur but don't have the first idea on what to do. I know I have to find another job soon, since this one can go away at any time but the fear that it would be too hard for me to handle just gives me anxiety. I know I have to lose weight, but the thought of walking outside just exhausts me.

It's like I am literally wasting away my life sitting on this bed (to the extent it has deformed into the shape of my butt!), waiting for some miracle to happen and make my life mean something.

I had a moment of clarity and just deleted all the games on my laptop, but the urge to find something to do is annoying me again. Instead of caving in, I am writing this. 

I don't think there is any ground breaking advice anyone can give me, so I suppose I am just venting at this stage.

This was highly unexpected! I think I've cried a few times already just feeling the support from all of you! I kid you not, I appreciate each and everyone that took time out to respond to my vent. I hope those that are in similar shoes can also find comfort in these words and this community.

&nbsp;

The cause for this is primarily two things, that if you address, will drastically improve the quality of your life, the people within it, and the things you're able to enjoy within your life.

&nbsp;

**Mindset** and **Mental Focus**.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

Mindset is important, because fundamentally, what you believe of yourself, and what you're capable of, is *exactly* what you'll gain and achieve in life. Now, this fact is hard for some people to accept and believe, because they believe that they already think about changing their lives enough to warrant different circumstances in their lives. 

&nbsp;

- I already think about getting a girlfriend all the time, so why don't I have one?

&nbsp;

- I already think about being more confident and stable in myself, so why do I still struggle with it?

&nbsp;

- I already think about making more money and being rich, so why aren't I rich yet, or at least making more money?

&nbsp;

- I already think about having a nicer car all the time, so why don't I have one yet?

&nbsp;

- I already think about working out more and having a great body, so why isn't my body great yet?

&nbsp;

- I already think about eating healthier and cleaning up my diet, so why is it still so hard?

&nbsp;

- I already think about becoming disciplined and motivated towards my goals, so why am I still lazy? Why do I still procrastinate?

&nbsp;

The answer to these questions, is because while you *do* sometimes think about having more in your life, the things you focus on are mainly thoughts of lack and neediness.

&nbsp;

- You aren't thinking about the qualities you should cultivate into your life in order to attract more high quality women. You're thinking about how every woman you find attractive turns you down, and how you'll never find a great woman.

&nbsp;

- You aren't thinking about how to gain confidence and become more comfortable with yourself in a practical way. You're thinking about all the times you've embarrassed yourself and felt unworthy. You're constantly looking at other people who are more confident than you, and comparing yourself.

&nbsp;

- You aren't thinking about how you can earn more money at your current job, or thinking about a business idea you can work towards to earn a higher standard of living. You're thinking about how much your job sucks, and how unfair the pay is. You're thinking about how lucky you'd be if you were to win the lottery, and wouldn't have to work anymore for the rest of your life, and then sulk about the fact that it will probably *never* happen.

&nbsp;

I could go on, but I think you get the point. It isn't enough to simply think about your circumstances, you need to think of them in a productive way. There's no point to complaining about where you're at. If your social life is empty, so be it. If you've never had a girlfriend, boo-hoo. If your job sucks and is sucking your soul from your body, fine. If you lack self confidence, and don't have any motivation or drive to do anything, well, you're just like 90% of the world. You aren't special because you're suffering with the same cluelessness and pain that just about everybody else goes through.

&nbsp;

It's simply reality that your life isn't where you want it to be. So since you're aware of that reality, instead of bitching about it, and how unfair it all is, drop all that shit, and start looking for ways to change your circumstances. Stop ruminating in useless thoughts of comparison and complaining. You've got to start looking at your life in ways that *solve* your problems, no bring constant awareness to them. 

&nbsp;

Your job sucks? Yeah, you know. You think that every day. So how can you change that? What actions can you take **today** to start working towards a better mindset, or a different job, or your dream job, or a different environment entirely?

&nbsp;

It's not always going to be big steps, but any step at all is better than standing still and complaining about how you *wish* things were different. Everybody *wishes* their lives were better than they currently are. But only a few take control of their mindsets, and put it to work *for* them instead of against them.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

Once you understand that your mindset needs to be adjusted, then you can look at mental focus, which is why you never *really* can find that constant motivation and drive to do the things you know you need to do. Focus is important, but also simple.

&nbsp;

Last week, you promised yourself that you'd start going to the gym, or studying more, or eating healthier. You promised yourself you'd do it for some personal cause, and you thought about all the things you'd be able to do with this new development. You came to terms with how shitty your life would continue to be if you didn't make a change, and come the next day, you got started, with a fire in your stomach to stick with it, *this time*.

&nbsp;

But 2 weeks later, you find you're right back where you started. Why? Is it because you're meant to be a piece of shit for the rest of your life? Is it because you aren't meant to be one of the ""healthy"" people? One of the ""fit"" people? One of the ""successful"" people? 

&nbsp;

No. It's because you lost focus.

&nbsp;

The day before you to took action towards your *promise*, you reflected on a lot of shit. You thought about your life, and where it is now. You thought about where you wanted to be, and why you weren't there yet. You thought about all the mistakes you've made, and how those mistakes screwed your life up bit by bit. You thought about how badly you wanted to change. You envisioned a life where you followed through on your promises from now on. You envisions who you'd be in 3-6 months, following through with your fitness, diet, social, personal goals. You envisioned all the improvements you'd gain in your life, all the people you'd be around, all the women you'd cause to fall for you, all the family member's who'd congratulate you, all the associates who'd look at you in jealousy.

&nbsp;

All this internal reflection caused you to hone your focus on one primary thing. **Your goal**. You spent about 1-2 hours thinking about all this stuff, so naturally, it's what you're focused on, and what you focus on, your draw to you (mindset, remember?). So all that fire? All that motivation and drive? It was just your mind doing what it does, putting all it's effort and energy on what you focus on.

&nbsp;

So why do you lose that motivation and drive soon after gaining so much of it during the reflection period? Because once you finally make the *last* promise to yourself that this time is the final time, you stop reflecting. You foolishly believe that those 1-2 hours of intense reflection is going to provide you with all the drive and push you need to accomplish your life dream, goal, or ambition.

&nbsp;

And in your foolishness, life punches you in the fucking mouth.

&nbsp;

- Boom! Unexpected bill that you forgot to pay.

&nbsp;

- Boom! Your girlfriend/boyfriend has been unhappy lately.

&nbsp;

- Boom! Your mom is sick, and we don't know how much time she has left.

&nbsp;

- Boom! You're having a harder time in that class because you can't understand the subject material, so now your grade is falling.

&nbsp;

*Now you're on the ground, shielding yourself from the hits.*

&nbsp;

- Boom! Now your stomach hurts from that thing you ate the other day. Gotta take a few days off from work.

&nbsp;

- Boom! Now you're not making money because you're home sick. So you've gotta put in even more hours next week to pay rent at the end of the month.

&nbsp;

- Boom! Plus your friends birthday is coming up, and you haven't bought them anything yet.

&nbsp;

- Boom! Also that girl you've been crushing on hasn't been paying you too much attention lately. Maybe she found someone else..

&nbsp;

Life doesn't stop. Life doesn't give you a pass and say, ""Oh well since you have direction now, I'll just let you go by and harass the next poor sucker"". It doesn't work like that. Life doesn't stop for anyone, and if you don't constantly reaffirm for **yourself** what it is you want to focus on, primarily, life will *always* be happy to give you a million other things to think about in place of your dreams.

&nbsp;

When you have those quarter-monthly crisises, where you suddenly look at your life and think to yourself, ""What the fuck have I been doing? I need to make a change **now**."" That's just the first step. All the planning you find yourself doing, all the reflection and visualization you do, it's what fuels the internal fire within you, but that fire doesn't last. That focus doesn't last. It must be reapplied until your dream is achieved.

&nbsp;

If the only time you *really* think about your goals is once every few months, when life takes a breather from beating your ass, you'll never truly change anything. Because you aren't giving your mind sometime to consistently focus on. You're just giving it a short nice thought to ponder over, before life is finished with it's break, and ready to hand you more fists.

&nbsp;

You've got to take control of your mental focus, and reflect over the things you want, *everyday*. You've got to envision and visualize yourself achieving your goals, *everyday*. You've got to think about how bad your life will continue to be if you don't take action, *everyday*. Because as you continue to apply that focus, that fire within you will continue to grow.

&nbsp;

> Do I have to do it every *single* day, forever?

&nbsp;

No. Eventually, you'll developed the habit and self discipline to just get shit done. But that'll take about 3-4 weeks of constant reflection before you can let up. Until then,  just understand the days you don't control your focus, your focus is controlled by life, and whatever it happens to feel like throwing at you that day.",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] A fun little read for why your life continues to suck.,1561,0.97
y298ud,"I spent the ages 10-23 HEAVILY addicted to video games and junk food. When I was 17, I added weed to the mix and became heavily addicted to that as well. I struggled so much to discipline myself and actually live the life I always wanted to, and it was so frustrating because I KNEW I wanted to quit playing video games… I KNEW I wanted to stick to a diet and get fit… I KNEW I wanted to quit smoking weed and be productive… but I always fell back into my habits.

Maybe it was 1 week, maybe 1 month, but I ALWAYS went back to what was comfortable and easy right when I hit a little bit of adversity.

Over time, I learned that video games, food, and weed weren’t the problem. They were always going to be available if I wanted them. I was the problem. I had some underlying issues that set me up to fail over and over and over again. Constantly falling back into the habits that kept me comfortable.

5 months ago I decided to really take control of my life, and since then I’ve lost 45lbs, haven’t smoked weed or played video games, and I feel WAY better than I ever did when I was constantly indulging in those habits. I hope that with this post I can help you do the same thing with your bad habits. This is a really long post so [if you'd rather listen to/watch a video about this topic you can do so here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoVVQIIHVw) but it’s not necessary unless you need more in-depth information (like I always do lmao). Everything you need is in this post.

First, realize that the habits are not the problem.

Like I said, if you CONSTANTLY go back to your bad habits when you know you’d be better off without them, there’s a deeper underlying issue. I’ve noticed that for a lot of people it has to do with anxiety or depression, and it was the same for me. I was always making up imaginary worst case scenarios for the future (anxiety), or dwelling on mistakes or tough situations from the past (depression). If you keep trying to stop indulging in your bad habits but you just can’t seem to do it, you have to fix the ROOT CAUSE. There’s no band-aid solution for this.

After lots of journaling and thinking about the problems I faced with discipline I realized 2 things — I was ALWAYS living in a semi-unconscious state and I was ALWAYS seeking instant pleasure. It’s probably the same for you, so here’s how I fixed those issues.

1. Living in an unconscious state

If you ever find yourself making a bad decisions while you’re THINKING about the fact that it’s a bad decision, you’re living in an unconscious state. If you’re ever reading/watching/listening to something and you have to rewind because you completely missed what was said, you’re living in an unconscious state. For me, the best way to SLOWLY overcome this was meditation, and I find a lot of people explain meditation in a really confusing way so I’ll do my best to make this really simple.

Meditation is the practice of sitting for any given amount of time and staying aware/witnessing your brain. If you can only meditate for 2 minutes at a time right now, then that’s fine. Just sit and stay aware of the thoughts that come up and right when you notice the thought, bring your focus to something happening in the moment. Your breath, the feeling of your feet on the floor, anything that’s happening now.

In practice, you’ll start to notice when your brain is trailing off in everyday life. When you’re reading a book and your brain starts thinking about something else, you’ll start to notice that and be able to bring your focus back. As you meditate consistently, it’ll become faster and easier to do so. It’ll help in LITERALLY everything you do every single day. It will make it so much easier to make decisions from a conscious state as opposed to constantly living in an unconscious state. Give it a shot.

1. Always seeking instant pleasure

The reason you want instant pleasure is because you’re validating yourself through RESULTS instead of ACTION. So for example if your goal is to stop eating junk food because you want to get fit, you’re validating yourself through the RESULTS you see. If you see progress in the mirror or on the scale, it makes it more rewarding for you to stick to your diet. The problem is that takes time, and we don’t like to wait.

If you instead start validating yourself through the ACTION you take or don’t take, you get pleasure right away. Instead of validating yourself through the weight loss or the changes in the mirror, validate yourself by eating the right calories/macros and working out. If you can change your mindset to seeking validation through actions instead of results, you CONTROL when you get validation. Making the right decisions becomes pleasurable in the moment AND you get to see the benefits later on in the form of progress toward your goal. It’s a win-win.

Once you make this change in your mindset, progress starts coming really fast. I promise. You feel good about yourself because you did what you knew you should do, and you feel EVEN BETTER later on because you see results of that action.

Doing both of these things also helps with anxiety and depression. Anxiety (I’ve found) comes from imagination in the wrong direction. You’re imagining that the future is going to be worse and anticipating it, and you subconsciously KNOW it’s going to come to fruition because you’ve been making the wrong decisions. If you start living more aligned with your conscience (through the 2 things I talked about above) you’ll start to anticipate the results. You’ll start to anticipate things going WELL because you know you’ve been making the decisions that will lead you there.

Depression (again, for me) comes from dwelling on bad decisions I’ve been making even when I know I can and should be living better. Following the things I talked about above also fixes that issue because you’re finally living how you know you should and you feel validated because of it. You don’t have anything to dwell on because you haven’t been making bad decisions to dwell on.

Regret is the best guide. If you regret an action, that’s your conscience telling you to stop engaging in that activity. If you regret playing video games for 7-12 hours a day (like me) that’s your conscience telling you to stop. If you regret eating ANOTHER cheat meal when you’re 60lbs overweight and you told yourself yesterday that the diet starts today (like I did), that’s your conscience telling you to stop. All the answers are within, and it’s up to you to make the right decisions. You CAN do it and it will be 100% worth it.. it’ll be tough but you CAN do it.

1cle0ag,"If you're in this subreddit, you've probably seen thousands of pieces of advice, thousands of quotes, hundreds of neuroscientific interventions and potential pills to help you 'finally become the person you've always wanted to become.'

# Diagnosing the Bullshit:

Let me explain.

So let's say you are 20 years old. Right now, your brain has spent 20 whole years not only developing, but PERFECTING its neural connections, to make you into the person you are today.

It has devoted quite literally thousands upon thousands of days towards habits in your life that you probably dont even recognise to be 'habits.'

Do you find it easy to buy stuff online? Open the fridge? Turn on your phone first thing in the morning? Walk to the shop to buy junk food? Play video games?  Turn on a porn site?

Quite literally anything and everything you do, is a result of fine-tuned neural connections that the brain has perfected because you've done these things so many times consistently.

When you do any task, your brain releases an amount of dopamine. Dopamine isn't the 'happy' chemical that people think it is. It is primarily the neurochemical involved in 'doing things'- so any time you do anything, your brain releases dopamine, so that the next time you do that task, because dopamine helps you to 'do things', by releasing it, the brain reinforces that behaviour, and makes that task slightly easier to do next time you want to do it.

So yeah to reiterate your brain right now is a highly efficient machine, and it does not like to be swayed off course from what it already knows.

Why?

Well as far as your evolutionary brain is concerned, all the habits you've built over your 20 years of life, have allowed you to survive.

Your ancient brain thinks all the things you do, all the junk food you eat, all the bullshit you do, is actually maximising its chances to survive on the Savannah.

Obviously no matter what habits you pick, if you live in a relatively safe country, you probably will survive in the world regardless, but your evolutionary brain doesn't know that. All it knows is that the way you do things right now are optimal for survival.

And that means your brain really fucking loves to do things how it's always done things. It HATES CHANGE. Because change quite literally could be life or death for your brain. So it will fight you tooth and nail to avoid change.

This is where the bullshit of the self improvement industry comes in. 'Change your life in 30 days', 'Change your life in 3 months', 'How I became a disciplined person overnight.'

Everything about your brain hates these statements.

And at this stage you may say, 'Oh but Mr Latter Vehicle 6648, what about David Goggins?' or whatever self improvement person you look up to, who 'changed their life overnight.'

This is going to be controversial, but I think people like Goggins are actually just mentally ill. Dont tune out just yet though, let me explain.

I dont mean mentally ill in a bad way. This isn't to disrespect the work people like him have done. But the ability to just 'flip a switch' and become a hard motherfucker, is so incredibly biologically abnormal, that it must be something insane like 0.00000000001% of people are able to sustain that- and I would imagine their ability to flip that switch is tied to years of hard trauma in their childhood, which most people who've come from a stable background, simply cant relate to. Thats not to discredit people like Goggins, im just saying, I think people like that have a form of 'positively impactful' mental illness.

That's to say, they are mentally ill, but it actually works for their life, so we dont talk about it in those terms. And it makes sense, like why would we create names for mental conditions that help people improve their lives? There's no point.

But it's super important to recognise that these people are not a narrative to base your life on, just like you wouldn't take advice from someone with severe schizophrenia.

So getting back on track here, when you try to implement any piece of advice from the self improvement industry heres how it always goes:

1. You try something new when you're super motivated
2. You completely transform your entire life for a week, 2 weeks, a month, or hell even 2 months for some people
3. Then randomly you wake up one day and its all fallen apart and you cant work out why.

And then you probably spend the next 12 months saying to yourself- 'man I wish I could just get back into that state of mind I had when I was super motivated'- but that state of mind never comes back, and if it does you just end up replaying the whole cycle again, and it falls off like it always does, again.

The reason you 'fall off' as I've mentioned is because your brain HATES change. So if you change everything, you're basically just biding your time, waiting for the day that you run out of cognitive energy to be motivated, and your brain goes back to the safe habits it knows best.

One hard truth you must accept is, your brain has spent 20 fucking years developing and strengthening its bad connections to make you how you are right now, so how the fuck do you expect 30 or even 60 measly days to flip that all around with a stupid '30 day plan.'

What life do you think your brain will pick? The disciplined one that you've tried to stick at for 30 days, or the one that you've hardwired and stuck at for 7 THOUSAND 300 days (20 yrs)?

30 is a very small figure compared to 7300. No wonder you fail to make any progress.

The quicker you accept how your brain works, and remove the ego involved in trying to quickly transform yourself, the quicker you will actually become the person you want to become.

If you ever want to change, you have to accept your brain for what it is and say to yourself 'ok brain, we CAN keep doing things your way, and in fact we are going to embrace things your way, but we are going to ALSO make some minor changes that you won't even notice ok?'

# Real Habit Building

And this is where ideas like atomic habits come in. if you want to be the kind of person that goes to the gym, then you need to make changes so so small, but progressive, towards going to the gym, that your brain doesn't even notice you're making these changes.

Now crucially, im going to break down what a habit actually is, because this is another point that the self improvement industry lies to you about.

The self improvement industry has a tendency to call something one habit, when its actually like 12.

Let me explain.

For example,  the habit of 'going to the gym', is not one habit. Firstly going to the gym, might involve:

Waking up at a reasonable time (one habit), getting out of bed (two habits), getting your gym clothes on (three habits), getting your keys and wallet/ water bottle (three habits), making sure to pack your gym bag (four habits), locking up your house (five habits), opening the door getting outside when perhaps you dont like being outside (six habits), walking to the gym for an extended period of time of like 5-30 minutes (7 habits), and ONLY THEN when you arrive at the gym, have you completed your seemingly 'one habit'.

No wonder your brain gets overwhelmed and refuses to go to the gym- it's like 7 changes simultaneously all wrapped up in the false assumption it's 1 change.

Lots of people may find that going to the gym is less than 7 habits though, they may find that 'waking up', getting dressed, going outside and walking, is how they can mentally break it down- so more like 3 habits instead.

But however many habits you think going to the gym is, is entirely dependant on just how different your current life is from the life you want to lead.

So if your somebody that usually walks to work and is happy waking up at an early hour and is pretty well disciplined in normal ways, then going to the gym may actually even be 'one habit' as people think it is.

But if you're the kind of person that hates being outside, you wake up late every day, you spend multiple hours on your phone, you go to bed late, and you never work out, then going the gym MUST be seen as 7 separate steps, because each one of those steps is unfamiliar to your brain.

It is better to assume your brain is unfamiliar with a task than to assume it can conquer it easily. It is easy to get excited and carried away with the prospect of habit building such that you want to change a million things at once, but it is much more reliable if you change just one thing at a time.

This is where you have to kill your ego and completely detach yourself from results based progress. Please trust me on this, because if you follow my methods, you will be able to maintain any habit you want for the rest of your entire life, so just because it may seem a little slow, it will reap unimaginably large rewards for you for the rest of your life. so just trust me on this, kill your ego, detach yourself from results and be patient.

If your goal is to go to the gym, and this is something entirely unfamiliar to you, you must start with habit one, which let's say is getting dressed for the gym.

You must get dressed for the gym every single day, but make sure thats all you do. you stick to just that one habit, and you commit to it for an entire month. after that month your brain won't even think about getting ready for the gym it will be the easiest task in the world.

This is where month two you then get into the habit of actually being outside. I used to hate going on walks and being outside. So I spent an entire month literally just making sure after I woke up I would stand outside. There was no condition for me to walk anywhere or do anything, simply being comfortable being outside was unfamiliar to my brain, so cognitively was a big step.

Month three, go for a walk/ get in your car to go to the gym. at this stage the preparation phase for the gym is like clockwork, you could do it in your sleep its that easy for you. Now for this whole month you simply drive/ walk to the gym. Honestly at this stage as crazy as it sounds, I wouldn't even enter the gym. simply being there every day was testament to all the progress I was making.

Only then on month four would I enter the gym and do a workout. But I would make sure the workout is quick because again actually working out is an unfamiliar place for my brain so I dont want to go into a whole 1 hr workout, because I know if I do that, then for no reason, im going to wake up one day paralysed and incapable of mustering the will to go to the gym, because 1 hr is too long and I won't want to do it, so it will all fall apart

So for month four, I will workout for 15 minutes. you can make that even shorter if you want. Remember DO NOT ATTACH YOURSELF TO THE RESULTS. Your only attachment should be to honouring your word and completing the habit.

For month 5 you can then increase the length of your workout if you want, maybe to 20 minutes, then the next month to 30 minutes.

# Where it gets exciting

This is where shit gets really cool. by building habits in this way you can very quickly after like 5-6 months, utilise principles of compound interest.

Once you are at the gym, if you increase the intensity of your workouts or the length of your workouts by lets say 20% a month then through compound interest this will happen:

Let's say you start small, so once you make it to that gym, you start with 5 minutes of gym time a day.

If you increase your time by 20% each month, by the second month, you'll be there for 6 minutes a day.

Continuing this pattern, by the end of 12 months, you'll be there for nearly 31 minutes daily.

You may say at this stage, hmmm yeah but 30 mins isn't that much.

But my friend compound interest is just getting started. If you carried on increasing your time by 20% at 12 months this is what would happen.

12 months- 30 mins per day

13 months- 36 mins per day

14 months- 43.2 mins per day

15 months- 52 mins per day

16 months- 1hr 2 mins per day

17 months- 1hr 14 mins per day

18 months (1.5 years)- 1hr 30 mins per day.

Wow. So with only 6 more months of slow increases, you went from 30 mins at the gym to 1hr 30 mins. EVERY SINGLE DAY.

This illustrates how small, consistent increases can DRAMATICALLY  boost your progress over time, much like how compound interest works with money.

And this principle can be applied to any habit you want to build. Make the changes so small that your brain doesn't notice, make sure the habit you are focusing on is a specific action and then keep a set percentage increase in the intensity/ duration of the habit and watch how you reap the rewards.

You could start ANY habit this way. if you want to read books and you dont read books, the self improvement industry would probably suggest you read 15 pages a day.

No. Kill the ego. if you dont like reading but you want to read, then 15 pages a day is a lot of fucking reading and you will give up very quickly.

Instead, for a whole month read one paragraph. I'm deadly serious. Not even a page. One paragraph- because you brain can then develop that network from the ground up- the action of picking up the book and actually committing to reading it even for one paragraph is actively and positively rewiring your brain.

And then the next month you may read 2 paragraphs, then 3 paragraphs then 1 page, then 2 pages, then 3 pages, then 5 pages, then 7 pages, then 10 pages, then 15 pages and BOOM before you know it after a handful of months you will be the kind of person that finds it easy to read books every single day.

# Where it gets even more exciting

Now you can concretely see how much progress you are going to make in under 2 years. 2 years is nothing in the grand scheme of your whole life and yet these 2 years will transform how you do everything. Crazy stuff.

Something I've done to keep me excited about progress is write myself a note on my phone, laying out all the habits I want to start, and then writing down all the progression that are going to occur to those habits.

And it's so so so exciting, because I can see with my own eyes that by this time next year for example, I'll be doing 100 press ups every single day, going on a RUN every single day (I naturally hate running), Ill be waking up early and countless other habits that are helping me towards my career.

So start a note on your phone or make a physical record of the habits you want to start and what progressions they are going to have each month, so you can see yourself just how successful you're going to be in your life.

# ROOKIE MISTAKES TO AVOID:

I could talk about this stuff for ages, but ill finish by mentioning pitfalls you DO NOT want to fall into:

\*\*\*Do not get cocky. The self improvement industry would tell you that you should start scaling up your habits after a week or two weeks of doing it. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS.

\*\*\*WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT SCALE UP YOUR HABITS UNTIL A MINIMUM A MONTH OF DOING THEM, A MONTH IS THE MINIMUM.

\*\*\*Secondly, do NOT juggle too many new habits at once.

You may think you are building 4 small habits- lets say you decided that you want to:

Go on walk every morning, meditate daily, have a skincare routine, and go on a run in the evening.

You may then think 'oh ok, so on month one lets do a small habit towards the walk, a small habit towards the meditating, a small habit towards the skincare routine and a small habit towards the evening run- what's the big deal right?' NO.

\*\*\*IF YOU TAKE AWAY ONE MESSAGE FROM THIS TODAY, IT IS THAT YOUR BRAIN DETESTS CHANGE.

So if you do 4 'small' changes at once, thats 4 x the amount of change, and thus a lot more cognitive load on your brain than you may think it is.

Imagine I gave you a 0.5kg dumbbell in one arm to curl. You'd probably feel nothing from curling it. The change would go under the radar.

But if I instead gave you 8 of those dumbbells suddenly I'm actually lifting 4kg of weight. I would notice this weight a lot more and perhaps feel a bit uncomfortable with it.

This is like your brain when you try to start too many small changes at once. So don't do it. Stick to one habit for now.

If you want to build multiple habits simultaneously, only do that once you are comfortable having built one habit at a time for a while.

# In summary

*Your brain hates change. The self improvement industry sells you too much change and false narratives around change.*

*But if you follow the principles I've laid out, you not only can grow sustainable habits but very VERY excitingly, they will be built on such a solid foundation in your brain, that you will be able to keep them going for the rest of your life if you choose to do so.*

Anyway I think ive typed too much as it is, so let me know if any of this was helpful, I hope my advice can help at least one person to improve themselves. Good luck everybody!!

# Important Edits:

I tried my method, and it led to the most success I’ve ever had in building habits.

However, after six months, I changed my environment and found myself living somewhere different. This change caught me off guard, and all my habits gradually regressed until I was back at square one.

Does this mean the method is useless? No.

It means two things:

1. Be mindful of your environment. Like really really mindful. Habits are deeply connected to the environments where they are formed and practiced. When you experience significant changes in your surroundings, it can become difficult to maintain consistent behaviors. For example, moving back home or returning to a familiar place like your childhood bedroom often leads you to revert to old habits. This regression happens because your brain tightly links habits to specific settings, causing you to subconsciously default to the behaviours you developed in those environments.

To counteract this, whenever you’re about to undergo a significant environmental change, such as moving or going on vacation, scale your habits back to the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM for a week or two. cap the intensity of the habits drastically. Then, gradually return to your normal habit intensity, but do so cautiously.

In essence, be aware that environmental changes can make maintaining habits much more difficult, so try to anticipate this as you adjust to your new surroundings.

2. You can NEVER be too cautious or gradual when building habits. To be honest, I got carried away during those six months where i was using my habit building method. I went against my own advice and ended up juggling about 12 different habits at once, many of which I was struggling to keep up with at that level of intensity.

Momentum is a great feeling, but it can lull you into a sense of false confidence with how disciplined you are. 

Even I fall into the traps I've recognised before. I can’t stress enough how difficult, yet essential, it is to set aside your ego when it comes to habit-building. Just take it slow. This is something I struggle with because, like many, I want to progress quickly and share my successes.

Anyway, I hope these edits help someone!",r/getdisciplined,You've got 'discipline' all wrong. Let me Explain: ,1557,0.98

icrw6v,"## Building habits that last

>**“We first make our habits, and then our habits make us” –John Dryden**

To create habits that last you must first understand 3 fundamental concepts: The habit loop, the power of systems, and the psychological warfare involved in creating habits.

## How habits work: The habit loop

In Charles Duhigg famous book ‘The Power of Habit’, a fundamental concept about the nature of habits is revealed. The concept is called ‘The habit loop’. The habit loop consists of three main elements:

**The Cue**: Something that influences us to initiate the habit, sometimes called a ‘trigger’. These cues can come in a number of forms; they generally create an emotional response that compels us to act on the impulse.

**The routine:** This is when you are performing the habit; generally you will be on autopilot as the habit at this stage is ingrained deeply into your brain. For instance, when you are brushing your teeth, you go through the same motions every night. Your brain does not need to use willpower to consciously think about how you are going to do it. You are sleepwalking.

**The Reward:** The reward is what fuels the habit, it’s the end game. The reward for brushing your teeth is that fresh feeling you get in your mouth afterwards. The reward for smoking could be the dopamine hit you get or the feeling of relaxation. If there are no rewards, there is no incentive for the brain to commence the habit loop. The more times you repeat a habit, the deeper the habit becomes ingrained inside your brain, and the harder it becomes to overcome it.

>**“The Chains of Habit Are Too Light To Be Felt Until They Are Too Heavy To Be Broken” – Warren Buffet**

[**Habit Loop Diagram**](http://imgur.com/RtoPI7G)

**Creating habits**

Now that we know the basic framework of how habits are formed and reinforced, let us get into some practical strategies for creating new habits.

We first need to create an association in our brain between the habit and the reward. Your brain initially does not want to use more energy than necessary; at the early stages, the association between the habit and the reward have not been established.

It’s common knowledge that going to the gym is good for you, but not everyone has gone to the gym long enough to create a clear association between the routine (exercising) and the reward (body transformation & and dopamine rush after workouts). Logical understandings are not enough to overcome the emotional inertia of creating a new habit. You need a real reference point, you need to experience the reward first hand for it to become real.

**Develop a strong cue**

To begin with, you must consciously create your own cues to remind you to begin the habit. The easiest cue is an alarm on your phone. Set your alarm with a message telling you to begin the habit. Have the alarm cycle every day at the same time. The cue popping up at the same time creates less mental hurdles for you to overcome and makes it easier for your brain to associate that time with the habit. You could also use objects as cues. Perhaps you have a chair in your house and you want to begin the habit of meditation. Each time you walk past the chair, sit down on it for a couple of minutes and meditate. Once you have consciously associated the object with the routine a couple of times the process becomes automatic.

## Create Systems

We create a system to prepare us for the inevitable contingencies that might occur. Systems are best made by taking precautionary measures by manipulating the variables within our control. Let’s say that you want to create the habit of waking up at 5 AM every morning.

Naturally, you would set your alarm next to your bed for 5 AM. However, you run the risk of hitting the snooze button (remember the early stages of habit creation are grueling and willpower is not enough). A simple system to combat this could be to simply have your alarm across your room and out of arms reach. Doing this forces you to get out of bed, helping you overcome the initial inertia of the morning, making it easier to ingrain the habit. Let’s say that you want to create the habit of eating healthy.

A system to help you with this could be having a simple food prep every Sunday. You could get all your healthy food ready for the week so that you don’t get tempted during the week. If you don’t create this system it will be far too easy to give in to temptations and eat all the delicious bullshit that can be found everywhere in the modern world.

When creating systems consider the following questions:

* What actions can I take prior to help make life easier for myself?
* What things should I avoid to make success more likely?
* How can I make it so that I am forced to do the habit?
* What pressure can I put on myself to perform the habit?
* Is there a environment that would better facilitate this habit?
* Is there a particular time of the day that would help create this habit?

## Psychological Warfare

The last war is fought in the mind. You must pledge guerrilla warfare against the voice in your head. The voice that tells you to:

\-***“just skip it this one time, you have worked hard and deserve it”***

\-***“Missing it one time is okay”***

\-***”I can try again tomorrow”***

\-***“I have been going hard! I can take a break now”***

When you hear this voice in your head tell it to **shut the fuck up**. The slightest ounce of resistance can ruin all your good work. You must be relentless in the first couple days of forming a new habit, don’t give yourself any excuse to skip a day. Each time you want to skip a day envision someone with a gun to your head, it’s that serious. You need this type of mindset in the beginning if you want to overcome the inertia. It might seem extreme but it’s well worth it, especially when the habit you create rewards you for the rest of your life.

You are literally the sum of your habits and can change your trajectory by strategically building the right habits. See where you want to go and began the habit creation process. Focus on ONE habit at a time until it echoes. I don’t care if it takes you a whole year to make that thing a habit, it’s far better to develop one good habit than to try creating multiple ones that never stick. You will know that you have formed the habit when you can’t sleep without completing it, when the thought of missing out on the activity actually pains you. Hope that helps!

jof75l,"""Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever"". I used to see it as just another variation of pain is temporary but victory lasts forever, but now I see it's portraying a completely different message to it. It's about the two different mentalities you can have in life. You can either be a quitter or getter. The problem with being a quitter is that it becomes a habit. You will always start to quit when it gets hard to that point, and you wouldn't able to push yourself any further. Meaning, you won't be able to evolve as a person. When you quit, the exact same pain doesn't ever go away. It remains there until the next time you have to face it. The exact same pain that's temporary becomes permanent as long as you keep quitting.

hiq9eg,"It's taken me years to figure out why my ""chores"" are piling up and why my goals are unmet.  I've been planning to do those things ""tomorrow"", but tomorrow doesn't actually exist.  Every morning I wake up and eventually realize it's not tomorrow, it's today.  Tomorrow never arrives and LATER never comes. **It's always today. It's perpetually NOW.**  I've been pushing those things into a place that literally doesn't exist.  I now realize that ""I'll do that later"" literally means ""I'll never do that"".  ""I'll just watch Youtube now"" literally means, ""all I'll ever do is just watch Youtube"".


That's a powerful thought.  Each of us literally has the power to change reality to suit us.  We can't control the past or the future, but we don't have to, because we can change the NOW, and the NOW is all that actually exists.  You don't have to work and work for hours and days on something you don't like.  You don't have to diet for weeks and weeks to lose weight.  You don't have to worry about tomorrow.  All you have to do is DO IT NOW.  Work now, not for hours.  Diet now, not for weeks.  **That's easy!** Even my lazy ass can do something difficult ""now"" as opposed to doing it for hours/days/weeks/months/years.   

OK, now I'm off to work.  Cheers.

EDIT: I had a surprisingly productive day (this method works!).  The point I'm making is that looking at a huge task can be greatly demotivating.  Of course we can't ""chip away"" at that huge task.  It's just too big. It will take hours/days/weeks/months into the future to complete.  ""All this work! I should have started this three months ago"" you tell yourself.  But when you realize that neither the past nor the future actually exist and that only NOW exists, then the task is not daunting.  In fact, it's really easy.  You don't have to do it for hours/days/weeks/months.  You just have to do it now.  Now is just a moment of time - anybody can do anything for a single moment.

7xmha1,"So for about maybe 3-4 months now I have been starting my day with a morning routine. I decided to start this morning routine because I was noticing that there was so much I wanted to get done in the day but I just never felt like I had enough time, energy let alone motivation to get it all done. ( I am sure you all know the feeling)

So I decided I would start out with waking up earlier (6:30am). Which I saw benefits from straight away. 

 This eventually led me to start gaining interest in morning routines, so I started watching and reading as much as I could on the topic i.e investigating what people like Tim Ferris, Tony Robins, Robbin Sharma, Jim Kwik etc do as part of their morning routines.

I started too see commonalities among these people, and started adopting them for myself. And slowly but surely I developed a morning routine for myself (8 habits in total) that I now perform every single day.

And honestly I have been blown away by the benefits I have seen from it. 

*Here are just a few of the benefits I have noticed from having a morning routine.*

***The Benefits:***

**1.More Productive:** 

This is probably the biggest benefit I have seen. How? Well in the last 4 months I have been able to start two Youtube channels (and releasing a video a week on the main one) run a successful mind-body exercise business, read multiple books and create an online course for Udemy. 

And I credit all of this thanks to having a morning routine. These are all things I have wanted to do for most of my life but never felt like I had the motivation or time to do them. It turns out I did. I just needed the right tools to do them.

**2.More Motivated:** 

This is the second biggest benefit I have seen from implementing a morning routine. We all know how easy motivation comes and goes. One minute we can be super motivated and then the next it is gone *completely.*  

There is a famous quote by Jim Rohn which goes. *""Motivation is what gets you started, habit is what keeps you going""*. 

And I would certainly attest to this. I have found that I don't have to wait around until I ""get motivated"" anymore, instead it now naturally comes after performing my routine.

**3.Improved Energy:**

I have seen a substantial improvement in my overall energy levels, especially first thing in the morning. I attribute a lot of this to the fact that I have now made exercise a daily habit (as part of my morning habits).

**4.Clearer Focus:** 

Again I attribute this to exercising every morning. I find that I am now able to focus intensely for hours at a time which is something I never have previously been able to do.

**5. Improved outlook on life:** 

I have found that having a morning routine has a massive positive impact on the way I my life and the world around me. I now feel a lot more motivated, driven, positive and accomplished. And feel like I am finally starting to achieve some the goals in my life. I now rarely end the day feeling like I haven't accomplished something for the day.

So they are the benefits I have seen, there is a lot more but these are the main ones. Ok so you are probably wondering, what are these habits?

*Well here they are:*

***My Habits***

**1.Wake up Early:**
 
I wake up at 6:30am every single morning. And cannot believe how much more time it has given me.

**2.Drink a Glass of Water:**

As soon as I wake up I drink a glass of water. It gives me a boost of energy and instantly wake me up. Why? Think about it when was the last time you went an entire 8 hours without drinking anything at all? Probably never. Well when you sleep you essentially go an entire 8 hours without drinking anything at all. Which means when you wake up your body is in a state of slight dehydration which is why giving it water first thing in the morning is so beneficial.

**3.Make a Plan:** 

After I drink my water I then go through and plan out my entire day using a system called MITs aka Most Important Tasks.

**4.Mindfulness/Meditation:**
 
I then go into 5-10 minutes of mindfulness meditation. It helps me to start my day with a clean slate and relax my mind before going into the day

**5.Exercise:**
 
I then go for a 10-20 minute run. Why? Because exercise is not only beneficial for your body but also your brain. I find that after I exercise I can focus better, think more clearly and concentrate for longer. All thanks to exercise.

**6.Eat a Nutritious Breakfast:**

After my run I then eat a nutritious breakfast. What constitutes a nutritious breakfast? Well contrary to popular belief the best meal at breakfast in terms of fuel for the body and for the brain is High fat (good fat) and High protein. Why? Because fat and protein are both slow release calorific foods which means you stay fuller for longer and have long lasting energy. My breakfast consists of scrambled eggs, sauteed spinich and 1/4 -1/2 avocado. A perfect combination of fat and protein.

**7.Enjoy My Breakfast:**

 Instead of checking emails, scrolling facebook or watching the news I instead choose to take the time to slow down and just appreciate my breakfast.

**8.Make My Bed:**

My final habit is making my bed and I have found this to be one of the most simple yet powerful habits I have implemented. If you want to know why then check out [this speech here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6OoCaGsz94&t) from a navy seal admiral.
 

Once I have completed all of these habits which takes about 1 hour I then go into doing my most important work and thanks to these habits I always find that I am able to think clearly and perform at my best. All thanks to having a morning routine.

So I hope that this short little post on my morning routine inspires you in some way to give a morning routine a go. Honestly you will never look back once you do. 

If you want to see the video I made on my morning routine and implementing these 8 habits you can [check it out here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJoGeLF7uRA).  

Thanks for reading this post I hope this is able to help you guys out because honestly the only thing I regret is that I didn't start having a morning routine early.


Best of luck :)

l1a0fv,"The rules of meditation are dead simple.

Rule no. 1: Focus your attention on your breath.

...That’s it.

The genius thing about meditation, however, is the overarching *unspoken rule* of meditation, which seems to contradict that one rule: you’re allowed to lose focus on the breath.

You see, when learning meditation, you’re taught that if this happens, you’re supposed to just note that it did and gently return to the breath. No need to get critical of yourself—in fact, a side goal of meditation is to observe first-hand the frenetic circus that is the mind. Thinking of random things and going off on tangents is natural and our job is simply to sit and observe it happen, and do what we can to reign it in.

The *unspoken rule* seems to negate the hard rule, but somehow the practice still works. This is because with meditation, it’s not just *ok* if you fail, it’s entirely expected—in fact, the act of “picking yourself back up when you fail” by returning to the breath, *is itself the practice*.

But this post isn’t about meditation. This post is about bad habits—and when it comes to ending bad habits, adopting what I call the ‘Meditator’s Mindset’, is the best and easiest way to succeed.

…

So, we’ve all been in the position of recognizing a nasty habit that needs to end. As stimulating or gratifying as it may be, it’s causing us to procrastinate, waste time and it leads to frustration and anguish as it slowly scrubs our chance at achieving our dream life. So we tell ourselves, *enough.*

I’ve been there a million times over.

The first step always involved looking at your options.

Option 1: Go for moderation. *Let me set a fixed amount of time per day to indulge. Perhaps set it as a reward for a decent work session.*

Option 2: Try weaning off the vice. *Probably best to not go too extreme too fast. Let me see if I can dial it down each week so that in a month I’ll be set.*

Option 3: Just go Cold-Turkey. *That’s it. Enough with this non-sense that I barely enjoy. Let’s just kill it off, now.*

So you try 1, and it doesn’t work. You try 2; doesn’t work. You try 3; doesn’t work. You try 3 harder; doesn’t work again. Ok, you try 3 super hard with super clear resolutions and a calendar with Xs and a r/ NoSurf post that screams THAT’S IT IM DONE PEOPLE aaaand… it doesn’t work.

Fugg.

What I hadn’t realized back then was that, regardless of path you take, you ***have to add that unspoken rule that says it’s ‘okay’ to falter.***

This is the Meditator’s Mindset.

With this mindset, you let go of any fantasy of one day being perfect forever. You stop with the obsession of keeping track of the number of days in a row you made it without your vice (and perpetually having to reset the clock in frustration). You now accept and *expect* that you will falter a bit, and that sooner or later you will fail. And that’s ok.  To be clear: there are several lines of defenses against faltering, like using webblockers or practicing mindfulness, but there’s a zero percent chance you’ll ever get it perfect and that's ok.

This doesn’t mean I allow myself to engage in my vices willy-nilly. No I have rules, just like there are rules in meditation. But I carry with me the *unspoken rule* to be compassionate with myself when I do the equivalent of losing focus on the breath. I gently detach from my vices when I catch myself doing it, I allow for some compassion and I revert my focus to what I know I’m supposed to do.

Self-compassion is key in meditation. Without it, you’d get frustrated at how often your mind switches to thinking about your grocery list or that work deadline. Then with that frustration, you’d have more thoughts and emotions, further distracting you from the task at hand. So compassion is not just what you *should* do to be nice, in meditation it’s altogether *required*.

It’s the same for you and your commitment to end your bad habits. By all means, have hard written rules and remind yourself of them everyday—this is what I do—but don’t ever forget that you are human, and that humans *evolved* to act on instinct and grab at rewards for survival.

Once you let go of striving for perfection and allow for some self-compassion, a funny thing starts to happen. You’ll start to see the vices for what they are. Sort of ‘meh’. We all tend to engage in our vices mostly as a way to relieve or distract away bad feeling, so if you lose the stress and regret of your willpower failings, you’ll lose a lot the inner turmoil, and the reason to indulge in the vice. The bad habit just sort-of sorts itself out.

Bottom line is this, just like your mind will wander in a meditation session despite that one simple rule, you are going ‘wander’ and do things impulsively. When you catch yourself in the act, keep calm, be compassionate towards yourself, and return to the breath.

Best,

hngkx4,"When I was in high school and college, I was successful. But then when I got out of school, I had a really tough time.  I realize now that part of the reason life became so hard for me is because school **teaches you to ""get a good grade"" instead of doing things because you truly want to learn.**

Looking back, when I was in school, I focused only the external rewards.  Getting good grades, getting into college, impressing my parents/teachers.  Obviously a lot of this is my fault (I take responsibility for everything I'm mentioning). But at the same time, most people I know had the same mindset as I did.

And I think that's because you getting a good grade and having high pass rates in their classes, is what schools care about.  They don't care as much about whether you are actually enjoying the process of learning.  Sure, a few good teachers might, but for the most part all you hear from schools and most people in our society, is that you need to get good grades, get into a good college, etc.

After college I went right into grad school. In part, because I didn't want to face the real world yet. Then, right after grad school I entered a really bad slump for several years.  I couldn’t get a job (or more honestly wasn’t really looking much for jobs), didn’t exercise, ate fast food for every meal, and played video games all day.  I didn’t do anything productive, and felt miserable.

I eventually turned my life around, but it was tough.

What I realized later, is that the way school teaches you sets you up for failure.

# How School Sets You Up For Failure 

* **School gives you the mindset to work to get a good grade, not because you really want to learn:** In school, they are constantly telling you how important getting good grades are.  That’s all anyone talks about - your parents, classmates, teachers.  “Let me see your report card” is what your parents say.  Not “is there anything interesting that you learned today at school, anything that inspired you?”  This mindset of learning solely to get the grade sets you up for failure later because it’s solely focused on an extrinsic reward (getting a good grade) and not an intrinsic one (wanting to learn).  So outside of school it leaves you with no intrinsic desire to do anything.
* **Schools structures everything you do:** Everything you do in school is strictly scheduled (when tests take place, when papers are due, etc.).  The problem is, outside of the classroom things are much less structured.  The path towards success isn’t as clear cut as getting a grade or getting into college. For example, if you want to get in great shape, there is not an obvious path to follow.  You have to make your own path by figuring out what workouts you will do, when you will do them, etc.  That is much harder to do, and school doesn't do a good job teaching us how to do that.
* **You can get by at school even if you aren't disciplined:** I got by with doing things at the last second. I wrote every paper just before they were due and crammed for every test the night before. Learning discipline and preventing procrastination weren’t necessary skills to learn because I HAD to do things at some point or I would get in trouble.  Unlike real life where it’s on you to do things - and there are often not as strict deadlines in place like there are in school.  In real life, you can procrastinate things forever simply because you can usually get away with it.  There is no deadline for working out, meditating, applying to jobs, etc.

# How to Succeed Despite What School Teaches You

&#x200B;

* **Because school teaches you to do things just to ""get the grade""...you need to train yourself to focus on the process instead of the outcome:** School gives you this mindset that you only do things to obtain a certain end result.  Not because you enjoy the act of doing them.  In order to combat this, you need to re-wire your brain to find joy in the process of doing things, not just the outcome. Let's say you want to start weightlifting. If you just do it to ""build muscle"" but you don't like the act of weightlifting itself, it's unlikely you will motivate yourself to stick with weightlifting long enough to build the muscle you desire (and even if you do you will be miserable doing it). But if you learn to actually enjoy lifting weights, and focus more on that, you are going to be happier and more likely to stick with weightlifting for longer. It doesn't have to be 100% perfect - you might not enjoy every single moment - but if you strive to find some things you like about whatever it is you want to do, you are much more likely to keep doing it.
* **Because in the real-world you don't have the structure that school gives you...Create a schedule with your goals and when you plan to do them:** One thing I realized when I finished school, is that in the real world, it's up to you to set your own schedule.  Outside of the classroom, no one tells you when to do things.  It's up to you to determine when you are going to work, cook, read, meditate, etc. At first I had no plan and never got anything done.  But then I started keeping a to-do list, and my life turned around.  I began to write down my specific goals for each day in my to-do list, and that really helped provide structure to my life - which helped replace the structure that school had provided me.
* **Because you can usually ""survive"" school even if you procrastinate or aren't disciplined...Get disciplined by building habits:** As mentioned earlier, school has strict deadlines in place (when tests occur, when papers are due, etc.).  And that means you never really have to learn to be disciplined.  Don't get me wrong, it's very helpful if you are more disciplined and don't wait to study until the last second (I know a lot of people here are working towards that).  But even if you procrastinate for a while, because there are these official deadlines in place, you eventually are kind of ""forced"" to get things done and will ""survive."" But in the real-world, you have to learn to be self-disciplined in order to get things done because there aren't these strict deadlines.  There are a bunch of keys to learning self-discipline, and there's no way I can cover them all in this post without making it even longer than it is - but one of the most important things you can do is focus on building habits.  According to James Clear, *""Habits are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day.""*  **The best way to build a habit, is to start small.  Don't try to meditate an hour a day, instead start with meditating just 5 minutes a day.  Don't do 100 sit ups a day, just do 10 sit ups a day.**  Over time, you will train your brain to get in the habit of whatever you are doing.  And in the long-run the small amount you do each day will add up to huge results.  Developing habits will help you be more disciplined and avoid procrastinating because you will do things as a matter of habit even when you aren't motivated to do things.

I hope some of these tips are helpful to people.  Once I realized the mindset I had developed in school was holding me back, I was able to re-train my brain to develop a new way of looking at things.  And now am a lot more disciplined and happy as a result.",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] School teaches you to ""get good grades"" vs. ""learning because you truly care about learning"": How the school mentality sets you up for failure in life (and how to re-wire your brain to reverse this mindset)",1525,0.98
hf3fqz,"A lot of people say it's better to focus on the process itself than the outcome (or end result).  For example, if you are studying, there are two ways to go about it:

1. **Outcome-focused:** Studying to get a good grade in a class you are taking.
2. **Process-focused:** Studying because you enjoy learning the material itself.

This has always seemed to make sense to me.  If you enjoy the process, you are going to be happier when trying to do productive things.

And you will also be more disciplined because you are more likely to do something you enjoy.

The problem is, very few people tell you how to **actually** do this.

So, I decided I would put together a method to focus more on the process.  It isn't a magical solution that works instantaneously, but hopefully can help someone out there.

# Method for Shifting Focus From Outcome to Process

**Overview:** One of the biggest reasons it can be hard to focus on the process is that there are often negatives in the process that occupy our mind.

For example, with studying, there are a lot of potential negatives involved:

* The intense concentration needed to read and retain information.
* The stress involved.  Especially when we worry about whether we've studied enough, feel guilty for procrastinating, etc.
* The pressure from society/family/peers to do well.
* In some cases, a dislike of the material

**So how to we fix this?**

The idea of this method is to shift to thinking increasingly less about the end results and more about the process itself, by **finding things you like about the process**.

Let's take studying as an example again.

**Step 1:**  Start by **finding a morsel of something you like in that process**.  This is just an exploratory phase so no pressure to figure it out right away.

For studying, there are many potential positives:

* The satisfaction of knowing you are acquiring new knowledge.
* The fascination of learning new/interesting material (even if it's overall not as interesting, maybe there is some interesting aspect)
* The feeling that you are accomplishing something productive.

Keep working on this step until you've found at least one element you like about whatever you are doing.

**Step 2:** Now that you've found something you like, **start concentrating on that aspect you like**, whenever possible.  It's totally fine if the things you don't like pop in your mind too.

Practice this step for at least several days, perhaps weeks or longer, before moving on to Step 3.

**Step 3:** After working on the previous steps for a while, you can move on to the final step.  For this step, whenever your mind shifts to thinking about the outcome or the negative aspects of the process, **try to shift it back to thinking about those things you like**.

For example, if you think about the pressure to get a good grade and start getting stressed, shift your focus to just reading the material because you find some of it interesting.  And take that pressure off yourself.

Keep repeating this step.  As time goes on, you will start focusing more and more time on the process, and less and less time on the outcome.  It probably won't ever be 100% perfect, but that's totally fine.  Even going from 0% process-focus to 50% process-focus would be a huge achievement.

**Final words:**

For me, this method has worked really well and made me focus a lot more on the process for certain things (e.g. weight lifting, working, etc.)

It's definitely not perfect - there are still plenty of times the outcome enters my mind.

But by focusing on the process more than I used to, I've been a lot happier when doing productive things.

And that's also made me a lot more disciplined because it's easier for me to motivate myself to do things I like (or at least don't hate as much!)",r/getdisciplined,[Method] How to focus on the process instead of the outcome (and be a whole lot happier and more disciplined as a result),1522,0.99
1mjziec,"I was sitting on a bench in the park last week scrolling social media on my phone.

An older guy sat down next to me. He must have felt my bad mood because after a while he asked me: ""Rough day?""

I dnded up telling him how I've been unhappy at work, how **it feels like everyone else my age is doing better**, and how I just feel stuck in this cycle of self-doubt.

Turns out the guy was a retired psychology professor who'd spent decades studying success patterns.

What he told me completely changed how I think about myself.

He mentioned this 20-year study that showed kids with higher self-esteem end up earning more later (!!! regardless of intelligence or background)

I wanted to oppose him, disclosing that I didn't grow up wit lucky circumstances that would allow me to develop self-esteem as a kid and teenager.

But before I could mention that, he killed my self-pity with a single line haha:

""The beautiful thing about self-esteem is that it that it can be built at any age.""

He explained that my brain has this filter that only lets me notice things that match what I believe about myself. (for the nerds, called 'reticular activation system')

It means that if deep down you believe success isn't for someone like you, your brain literally hides opportunities.

You won't notice the networking chance, you won't see the business idea, you won't even apply for jobs you're qualified for because some part of you thinks ""that's not my place""

He concluded with something that completely changed my perspective on why I was always failing with discipline: **""People with higher self-worth have higher dopamine levels naturally.""**

More energy, focus, motivation, and therefore more discipline. They sabotage themselves less because they actually believe they deserve good things."" -> f\*\*\*, that's the opposite of me :)

When I said that sounded kind of overwhelming to change, he shook his head and told me that all I need is to start with tiny things that are easy to do daily, like putting sunscreen on or drinking water when you wake up.

This seems to work because your brain is constantly looking for evidence about who you are. Right now it might be collecting evidence that you're lazy or unsuccessful. Start giving it different evidence to work with.

Been thinking about this conversation all week and started with a few small things (found some good inspo on this [Reddit list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stopscrolling/wiki/index/)). Kind of training myself to be disciplined with simple stuff. And I swear I'm already starting to be more disciplined with hard stuff.

7os2qa,"Hey guys,

I've been doing a series of 30 day self-discipline challenges from cold showers to gratitude journaling.

But the latest 30 Day No Complaining Challenge has to be the hardest yet the most rewarding. I've experienced a range of benefits from better problem-solving skills to better relationships and a more positive mindset.

[You can check it out here](http://www.30figured.com/no-complaining-challenge/) (includes images of cats looking pissed because why not) or alternatively read the full post below.

**The Challenge:**
 

Go 30 days without complaining.

 
**The Benefits:**
 

Deeper appreciation for life
Develop problem-solving thinking
More positive attitude
Better conversations
Jedi mind control
People become more positive around you
Ability to not let sh*t annoy you.
 

**How To Do The 30 Day No Complaining Challenge**
 

Use a rubber band or a hair band around your wrist.

 
If you begin to complain and manage to be aware of it, stop yourself and ‘twang’ the band. This programs your brain into recognising complaining as a negative action and makes you more mindful every time you do it.
 

If you complain, add another day onto the 30 days.
 

Moaning is defined as speaking negatively about a person or an event without citing a solution to fix the problem.
 

If the problem can’t be fixed, then it isn’t worth complaining about and should be accepted.
 

**My Experience And Benefits Of Not Complaining**
 

I’ve been wondering how to stop complaining for a while now as I could see the more I complained the less happier I became.
 

And when I set myself the 30 day no complaining challenge I had very little faith I could do it.
 

For one, I’m British. Apart from Quidditch, cups of tea and monocles, us Brits love to piss and moan. We moan about the weather, the government, bills, shoddy service, cold calls and how expensive everything is. We even moan about how tired we are of moaning.
 

So did I manage to stop complaining and start living? And perhaps more importantly, what did I learn from it?
 

**People Complain A Lot**
 

The first thing I observed was that I complain a lot. I see myself as a generally positive guy who believes every problem has a solution.

 
However, on my first day I counted seven moans and two of them I wasn’t even aware of until after. In total, I ended up adding 12 days.
 

If moaning is buried deep into your psyche, like me, then it is something that you’re  going to have to be very focused to get rid of but the results are worth it. Read on to find how it can have a massive, positive impact on your life.

 
**Ability To Appreciate Other Things In My Life**
 

Sometimes I would feel a twinge of anger at something, go to complain and then stop myself.
 

Trying to let go off the thought can be difficult. Our brains need an alternative direction so I replaced the thought with thinking about something I was appreciative of in my life.
 

It’s a good idea to spend five minutes writing these down first before you start the no complaining challenge. That way you’ve got a go-to list in your head.

 
Once I had dropped the negative thought and replaced it with a thought of something I appreciated, I would instantly feel more positive.

 
**Started To Have More Control Of What I Worried About**
 

When you become more aware of the things you complain about, you become more mindful and analytical.

 
You naturally start to filter out the trivial stuff (usually the small stuff that’s just mildly irritating parts of life) and become more analytical on how to solve the bigger problems.
 

If you stop moaning and rather try to think of a solution this instantly drowns a negative thought before it ever has a chance to surface.
 

This also stops you from feeling the negative physical symptoms from the thought. Anger, disappointment and frustration all get buried and are replaced with proactive solutions.
 

This meant I was walking round feeling happier and calmer. And you can do the same. If there aren’t any solutions, again, simply let the thought go and replace it with something positive.

 
**People Become More Positive Around You**
 

As Paulo Coelho, author of The Alchemist, says:
 

“Happiness is contagious and will always manage to find a solution.”
 

It’s true. People generally tend to be a mirror of yourself reflecting back at you.
 

(Disclaimer: However there are some people no matter how positive you are will always try and bring you down and you should avoid.)
 

I noticed that while generally being less negative, the people around me seemed happier.

 
That’s not to say I went round with a irritating false sense of optimism all the time (hey life can be tough, we are all suffering in some way), but rather just was more realistic on what mattered and what didn’t.
 

**Developed An Understanding Of When ‘Complaining’ Can Be Appropriate**
 

Distinguishing between complaining and reaching out for advice is an essential part of knowing how to stop complaining.
 

Rather than moaning about a problem, ask your friends for their input if it’s something that can be solved.

 
There’s a difference between moaning and reaching out for help and generally people are quite flattered that you’d come to them for advice.


**Conclusion**
 

Moaning is a habit of many, but rarely useful. Knowing how to stop complaining can provide you with the tools to enjoy life more, form better problem-solving skills and better relationships.

""I was not always (toxic). I have become (toxic) because of (someone or something else).""  
""I am never going to find love/get a job/get fitter because I am a pathetic loser.""

Do you sound like this often? Are your most common emotions self-pity and self-loathing? Congrats, you are stuck in victim mode.

Here are 10 simple rules I use to drag my little ass out of victim mode.

# 1. STOP MAKING VENTING YOUR PERSONALITY

Yes, you can talk about the rough week you have had, or about having a hard time with the kids or your manager dropping passive-aggressive reminders on Friday after-hours. That's what friends and family are there for.

**What you cannot do is make your problems your entire personality**. Do not vent SO MUCH that you become *known* for venting about that particular problem(s). All conversations cannot be about your **recurrent problem(s)** \- there HAS TO BE a point in space-time that you do *something* about it.

Can you do something about it? Yes. Get on it. No? **Congrats - it is not a problem.** It is a bad situation you have to tide through. That's that.

# 2. YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE NOT YOUR THERAPISTS

Friends and family are supposed to have your back through tough times. But they are regular people. They fight their own battles every day. They can only help you so much. Expecting your friends and family to help ONLY by listening to you rant all day, every day is unfair.

One, stop asking for their advice and making them do the emotional labour when you have NO PLANS of working on their advice.

Two, **they aren't therapists** trained to offer you care that you require in extremely trying times. It is unfair to expect that of them. If you can afford it, go to therapy. If you cannot, read books, blogs, reddit subs pertaining to your situation till you can afford therapy.

Three, **communication only sustains two-way**. You cannot dump all over them in a conversation and walk away because **you** feel lighter. Listen to their verbal and non-verbal cues.

# 3. GET INTO AN ACTIVE FIX-IT MINDSET

An obsessive ""Fix it"" attitude for the (currently) most pressing problems of your life.

**Go on a problem-vomit** \- write down all the problems ruining your life right now. Pick the THREE WORST and start working on them.

Sometimes, drastic changes are necessary. You can only do so much damage-control on a bug-infested floor. Sometimes, ripping the floor out is the best choice.

Some problems are un-fix-able. A toxic job that you cannot afford to leave. An unreasonable elderly parent needing care. A chronic condition that can only be controlled, not cured. For those, find out ways you can LIVE WITH IT and MAKE PEACE WITH IT and work on those instead.

# 4. ""OTHERS"" ARE NOT THE YARDSTICK OF YOUR SUCCESS

Social media has us believing that people's one-minute highlights are their real lives. **Nobody has better or worse lives** as a whole. They have *aspects of life* that are better or worse *than yours*. If someone has something that you don't, there's someone that doesn't have something that you do.

How long are you going to run from one goalpost to the other, trying to achieve what *others* have? How long will you spend running after others' dreams? When will you run after *yours*?

Nobody's lives are perfect. The Earth is not designed that way.

Delete social media if you have to.

# 5. THE WORLD IS NOT OUT THERE TO ""GET YOU""

Contrary to what that little voice in your head will have you believe, NOBODY is out there to *get you* (unless you are being stalked or sum). Nobody *has the time* to come ""get you"" - the world is equally fucked for all of us and life is generally unfair.

If you identify a toxic person/situation in your life, work on pinpointing them and communicating/removing them from your lives. Isolated toxicity perpetrated by one person or one group is not LIFE coming to GET YOU.

Get out of your bubble that you are special and everybody that disagrees with you is a hater.

# 6. STOP SAYING ""I HATE MY LIFE"" - AS A RULE

Because you don't. **You hate what it has come to.** You hate what you have made of it. You hate the abuse that has been committed against you. Unless you are out living in a war zone or dictatorship (basically, a situation you did not choose, of an enormity you cannot change and trying to protest will get you killed).

If you live a regular life, with a regular job, a regular family, regular problems of varying scales that aren't *unheard of* \- that is, the life of every other person complaining about their life on the internet - if you live that life, **stop saying ""I hate my life"" as a rule**. If you have started feeling disenchanted with life, **identify the reasons** why instead of a general hate for everything in your life. Why do I feel like I hate my life? What about it can I change? What about it has to be learnt to live with?

# 7. STOP SAYING ""I AM NEVER GOING TO DO (DREAM ACTIVITY)"" - AS A RULE

What is it that you think you will never achieve? Why do you think so? What is stopping you? Is there someone/something actively stopping you? Can it be stopped/removed? Can it be worked around?

**Past rejections do not define you.** Past rejections only define your past. If you are the same person that you were in the past when you got rejected, you will get **rejected again**. If you are a different, better person - the chances of getting rejected *because of you* drastically reduce.

You are a brain and a body. You are a human. Nothing more, nothing less. Why will you not get a partner? Why will you not have a family? Why will you not get a job? You are kind and smart and you've read this post till now - which means you're willing **to actively put in the work.** You're way ahead, you're already on the path to get where you want.

# 8. I AM TOXIC BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO BE SO

Negative situations in life like unnatural death of loved ones, an abusive partner, humiliation due to social status etc often embitter people to the point that their **reaction to that negative situation becomes their whole personality**.

It is favourable for evolution that we learn from our past mistakes and put our guards up. But, being embittered and cynical and hateful only drives away all potentially positive experiences away from you. For example, if you start ""hating all women"" because one girlfriend cheated on you - you are actively driving away good women from entering your life.

Negative situations induce negative reactions. But you choose your reaction. You choose its length. You choose whether it stays a reaction or becomes your personality.

# 9. SAY SORRY AND MOVE ON

You are human. You are allowed to make mistakes. What you are not allowed to do is not take accountability for them any time.

Look inside. Your heart knows, your body knows, you know - you made a mistake. Say your apologies from the heart and move on. **It does not make you a smaller or weaker person to accept your mistakes.** It makes you bigger and brighter. A small man is always one that thinks he is too big to use his words and say his sorrys and thank yous.

# 10. DONT COMPETE TO HAVE THE WORST LIFE

Friend complaining about their in-laws? You do not need to make that about yourself by complaining about your in-laws even louder.

**Venting about bad life conditions are not contests.** They are spaces to empathize, listen and offer advice. You may feel like you are being relatable but all you're doing is trying to one-up them. And, in what? A contest you made up in your mind to see who has a worse life?

Nobody's story is about you. It is about them. Let them have it. Your suffering can take a backseat till the end of their story or for the day.

**DISCLAIMER:**  
This is just general advice for people wondering whether they're victimizing themselves or whether their lives are just irreparably ruined. This is not some ""Pull yourself together because mental illness is not real"" post. This is advice. If your quality of life is under threat due to a mental illness, toxic or abusive family member(s) or friend(s), sexual abuse, toxic work conditions, poor physical health - then this post cannot help fix it. It can at best act as a wake up call.

jg9icy,"21 male training to be a chef.

I feel like any 21 year old, I like alcohol, partying and I thought it was OK to show up to work late.

This changed when I was given a lesson by the head chef. He asked do I know what respect means and I said ""yah it's being nice to others""

How wrong was I, he went on to tell me more about respect and asked if I respect my fellow employees. Of course I said yes but I felt nervous and like I was punched in the face.

Everything he said was absolutely right, if I respected my self I would make sure my work shoes and my chef jacket was clean each working day, I would watch my mouth because I respect my workmates and if I respected my team I would show up on time eager to get started.

5tf7aw,"With this method I’ve done even the most soul crushing tasks and I feel awesome. This works even if you're a seasoned procrastinator or you're already in the state where you think that you don't care about yourself!

I’m severely depressed and the last couple of months have been a really rough patch, and I know that a lot of you might relate to the feeling when you really want to get it done, but you can’t muster the strength to do anything.

Even if you start doing the task the overwhelming thought of how big the task is crushes any motivation that you might have within minutes of starting it. Even if it is something small that could be done within 30 minutes. 

I think a big part of my depression roots from my lack of action and procrastination, because I’ve been thinking that I’m a lazy piece of shit for a very long time. 

I got tired of it and started to look for solutions, mostly on how to overcome depression, but I ran into something that I wasn’t expecting – a method on how to get anything done when you’re super depressed. 

I want to thank the author and if you are depressed this has some real practical advices on how to deal with your depression: http://karlolabs.com/depression/rare-exercises-on-how-get-st-done-when-youre-crippled-by-severe-depression/

**The god sent method**

I’ve re-written little what the author wrote, but it still stands true. 

**The cycle of procrastination and how it reinforces your procrastination**

You want to do the thing -> You try to do the thing -> Your bran tells you that it is too hard or there is no point -> You don’t do the thing -> You feel even shittier about yourself 

And the next time you try to do something again you remember this cycle and how you didn’t do anything and you tell yourself that you will probably won’t do it again. 

If you’re a seasoned procrastinator like me due to my depression then this is deeply rooted into you and even the thought of you doing the tasks crushes your soul and any will to do it, because you know there is no fucking point. 

The answer is: **MICRO-to-do list**

I know you’ve seen enough posts about To Do lists, but this is way different. This tasks is made for the deeply depressed, for those that are mentally ill and can’t pull themselves together to even take a shower. So if you’re not like me, this should skyrocket your results. 

What you do is break every task into MICRO tasks, and this is not splitting your task into smaller ones, this is doing MICRO tasks. Yes it takes some time to write it down, but the results are unquestionable. 

For example, everyone told me to go to the gym and that would help my depression, but I couldn’t do it. I just didn’t want to face the world – this is how I wrote my MICRO-to-do List to get to the gym. YES, to get to the GYM! That was 75% of the battle for me – here is how it looked. 

1.	Sit up from the bed
2.	Stand up
3.	Take the gym bag
4.	Go to the closet
5.	But gym clothes in the bag
6.	Go to the corridor 
7.	Put on the jacket
8.	Walk out the door
9.	Wait for the bus
10.	Get on the bus
11.	Walk in the gym

This is what I call a MICRO-routine. If you’re scoffing and saying that this is ridiculous FUCKING GREAT!!!!!!! You see, even you’re procrastinating ass is thinking that these tasks are too ridiculous to not being able to do. 

You see, you get the ball rolling and it gets easier with every task on the MICRO list. A tip that was on the website, that also helped me, was to fold the list, so you can see only 2 – 3 those MICRO tasks at a time. 

Trust me, your brain will be blabbering with thoughts like: “Go to the closet? Pff, too easy. I can put the clothes in my bag no biggies, yeah walking out the door is simple” and this thought pattern turns you into an unstoppable monster.

You can do it for every task, for EVERYTHING!

If you don’t know how, write in the comments and I’ll help you out. 

The KEY is to write down the smallest tasks possible. Let me rephrase it THE SMALLEST STEP POSSIBLE!

dc0ozu,"My life involved a lot of drinking after work. We would visit multiple bars and drink our night away due to the corporate culture of heavy partying. After a while, this became an unhealthy habit for me. I became a heavy drinker.

One day, I went home late drunk. Found my dog lying on the floor, shaking. I took her to the vet as fast as possible and luckily, nothing happened except for some plastic found in her stomach. The vet was a behavioural expert with animals. He told me that my dog was extremely lonely, which is why she kept chewing and swallowing plastic every time I came home late. This incident was so frightening that the next day after work, I didn’t even consider sipping alcohol. I went straight home to my dog. Took her for a walk.

The result was instant. She looked like the happiest dog in the world. Ever since, I go home straight away after work, drink less, and my dog is happier than ever. She doesn’t chew or create a mess around the house anymore. I got this advice from a friend of mine, who’s a behavioural scientist. He said this method replaced two bad habits through a “physical routine” and “pleasure.”

Drinking after work was a routine that I had to break. Keeping my partner happy and healthy was more important to me than drinking. His wellbeing and our healthy relationship was a form of pleasure.

According to neuroscience, connecting pleasure and physical action is extremely powerful.

11t049j,"Hey everyone. Sharing this guide I wrote for my mental health side project about a concept called ""kaizen."" 

In my 20s, I lost everything (my home, my job, my partner, and more) due to mental health issues and addiction. 

But I made it through, and I got better using kaizen. Today I’m in excellent health. I have a great career, home, and community. My life is filled with positive relationships, strong habits, and a lot of joy. I owe a lot of it to this process. 

**What is kaizen?** 

Kaizen, directly translated from Japanese, means “good change.” But the deeper meaning is: “small daily improvements over time that lead to exponential results.” Kaizen isn’t just a philosophy. It has evolved into an extensive growth system used by top companies all over the world to make continual progress.

You can use the same kaizen principles for your self-improvement.

It can often seem like a monumental challenge to change your health or situation for the better. But, the strongest brick wall is still laid one brick at a time. Time is passing anyway, so why not use it to make even the smallest of adjustments? One day you will look back and wonder how you got so far, so fast.

**Essentially, the kaizen method is this: Break down any task into an action step so small that you can complete it right away. Make each goal so simple that there is truly no excuse to put it off.**

Perhaps you cannot clean your room, but you can put one piece of dirty laundry in the basket. That is kaizen. If you cannot vigorously exercise, but you can complete five squats–that is kaizen.

Perhaps you cannot meditate, but you can close your eyes and take three deep breaths. You may not be able to confront a problem in your family, but you can write down one sentence on what you want to say.

In each of these, you are taking back control and still moving toward positive change. Seriously, keep breaking down your longer goals until it clicks in your mind that ""I could do this right now."" 

This is where the power of Kaizen lies. **Instead of doing nothing, you’ve done something. Metaphorically, that is a 100% improvement from before.** This is astounding progress!

Objects at rest always take more energy to move than objects already in motion. This simple law of physics applies to your brain and mental health as well.

After folding one piece of laundry, you might find yourself cleaning your entire room anyway, because the first step is always the hardest. But if you don’t, that’s okay too. You have made headway.

**Great kaizen skills build upon each other.**

If you haven’t written in your journal yet, write one word today. Write a sentence tomorrow. Write one word again the next day, because you aren’t feeling as well. Then, write two sentences. Then, write three.

**Eventually, you won’t need kaizen because you’ve slowly developed a habit at a pace that was enjoyable and simple. You’ll start to automatically complete your daily routine with full workouts, longer reading sessions, and the intentional practice of new skills.**

If you find yourself skipping an important habit for multiple days or weeks, start over with kaizen. Make it easy and exciting to bring simple habits back into your life.

Self-improvement programs fail when you start at level 10 instead of level one. You excel at it for a week, but then slip back to where you started (or even further if you burn out).

Successfully changing your health and position is a long-term game. You can, and will, create a better life.

In order to stay motivated and consistent, break long-term change down into multiple short-term wins. Keep making daily steps forward, and you’ll be surprised how far down the trail you can hike.

**If you can’t, don’t, or won’t get started right away, the task is not small enough.**

If you’re struggling to break huge goals down into something like this, I made this [5-1-30 goal planning sheet](https://helm.today/tools#5-1-30) a long time ago. 

Start with 5 year, break it down to one year, break it down to 30 days, go kaizen from there.

gnoxlj,"I've finally figured out why waking up at 5am is a shared habit held by a lot of effective people. It's not that you get a few extra hours of distraction-free time. You can arguably get more quiet hours by staying up late - waking up early isn't the answer. It's also not that you have the discipline to go to bed early. Going to bed early is great and all, but it doesn't actually achieve anything.

When you're exhausted from a hard day's work, sleep sounds pretty damn good - there's no discipline needed. You won't get much benefit out of waking up early, or out of going to bed early. As with most things, those 'hacks' are obfuscating the obvious reality. Doing the work is the secret is to success.

Edit: I think a lot of people are missing my point. Doing work is a much bigger factor of success than following a prescribed sleep schedule.

c69ngr,"**""'Time management' is really a misnomer—the challenge is not to manage time, but ourselves. They key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.""** \- Stephen Covey

Yesterday I posted here on how a productivity app is not going to make you more productive. Here's [the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/c5sxv0/plan_no_tool_or_hack_is_going_to_make_you_more/).

To summarize that post:

* Productivity is defined as—meaningful and purposeful work that uphold and refine your deeply held values.
* Values are your strong beliefs that must be upheld through action—they cannot be upheld through thought.
* In order to discover your values and be more productive, you must learn to pay attention to what you've been paying attention to and becoming more discerning with information that you are able to take action from.

It's like Neo [learning Kung-Fu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YhJxJZOWBw&t=) in *The Matrix*.

He downloads all the information and immediately goes to the sparring program to implement and refine his skills.

From there, he refines his skills (adaptation and improvisation) and acquires wisdom (""You think that's air you're breathing?"").

It is only by refining the information and implementing what he's learned that he is able to later stop bullets.

""Stopping bullets"" is the equivalent of optimizing your productivity consistently because you've paid attention to what information you NEED to maximize your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual modules.

Only then can you truly know your purpose in life and have the energy and clarity to endure the relentless onslaught of agents trying to stop you at every turn.

You—and only you—can solve the problems you were put here on this Earth at this time to solve; to stop the bullets that are killing people's bodies, relationships, minds, and spirits every day.

Which pill are you going to take?

* The Blue Pill—and stay in oblivion and consumed by the information that is [destroying your health](https://www.earth.com/news/smartphone-notifications-changing-brains/), and [crushing your spirit](https://www.barrons.com/articles/young-people-are-increasingly-depressed-and-anxious-and-no-one-knows-why-51556627408).

**OR**

* The Red Pill—Where you acknowledge your brain is the most complex object in the universe—that it is a microcosm of the universe—filled with infinite potential and power and the strength to endure the [terror and pain and discomfort and suffering](https://youtu.be/hA37Aed3yak?t=42) that being unplugged causes.

If you chose the blue pill, I wish you the best in continuing to be a source of [Narcissistic Supply](https://youtu.be/hA37Aed3yak?t=42) and wiping out on the wave of acceleration we're all on.

If you chose the red pill—surf's up.

**\*How to Manage Your Energy\***

In order to deal with the ever-increasing rate of acceleration, you have to start small.

Yesterday's action steps were one small ritual you could create to become aware of your values and what you're paying attention to.

Also, if you do this properly and pay full attention to it, you'll start to notice how important rituals are and how they help us shift our attention meaningfully.

From here I'll be referring to Jim Loehr's and Tony Schwartz's book, [The Power of Full Engagement](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Full-Engagement-Managing-Performance/dp/0743226755/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=power+of+full+engagement&qid=1561659229&s=gateway&sr=8-2).

***Download This Into Your Brain:***

* Every one of your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors has an energy consequence, for better or worse
* Performance, health, and happiness are grounded in the skillful management of energy
* The more we take responsibility for the energy we bring to the world (**red pill**), the more empowered and productive we become
* To be fully engaged, we must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused, and spiritually aligned with a purpose beyond our immediate self-interest

Write this on your whiteboard. Carry it around on an index card and look at it every day. Tattoo it backwards on your chest and look at it in the mirror every day—this is the model of productivity you must adapt to be truly productive. Without it, you're hosed.

***The Four Principles:***

**Principle I:** There are four sources of energy—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.

**Principle II:** Energy capacity diminishes from both overuse and underuse.

**Principle III:** Like a muscle, you have to push beyond your capacity in order to build capacity and allow for adequate recovery

**Principle IV:** You must create a positive energy ritual to you give your full attention to. [Yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/c5sxv0/plan_no_tool_or_hack_is_going_to_make_you_more/) explored that.

***Oscillation:***

Think of your heart—with its constant state of work and rest. Feel your pulse. Go ahead, I'll wait...

Ok, that is the natural way you spend and renew energy. This is known as oscillation or the ultradian rhythm, and it is at the heart of full engagement and meaningful and energetic productivity.

***Linearity:***

Now think of a heart that has flat-lined.

This is the rise and grind culture.

This is the humble brag about not sleeping and ""succeeding"".

This is the effort to ""push through"" with willpower, self-control, discipline, caffeine, and sugar.

This is the one too many drinks you have every night to wind down, or the pot you smoke to sleep.

This is the ""I deserve to get fucked up every weekend, sleep in, eat like garbage, complain about my life, do nothing to improve it, and go to bed Sunday night feeling miserable and dead inside"" lifestyle.

This is the constant consumption of relatable content in the form of ""I wish I were dead"" memes.

This is thinking that technology and the latest and greatest app is going to solve your problem.

This is swallowing blue pills by the bottle as you obliviously cruise through the reality you've created for yourself and think that nothing can ever be done about it.

This is the junk food you eat because you ""don't have the time"" to cook healthy meals (**physical energy**)

This is the porn you engage with because you're too busy, exhausted, anxious, and depressed to develop a social life (**emotional energy**)

This is the constant passive consumption of YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, **REDDIT**, Tinder, Instagram, Snapchat, Shazam that fries your brain and doesn't give you the intellectual challenge you need to thrive to be effective and productive in the world. (**mental**)

This is the day-in, day-out, drudgery of work you're doing and feel absolutely no connection to and it's slowly eating you away inside and causing you to dig yourself further into the hell of linearity and there's no way out (**spiritual**)

***The Knowledge Economy***\*\*\*:\*\*\*

We live in a knowledge economy, where our minds are our best assets and the economy grows by having our energy at full capacity.

But we work under the industrial model—go to work, toil for some impersonal boss, and be miserable and exhausted.

Linearity—in today's world—leads to dysfunction and death.

A total flat-line as opposed to the vibrant and robust rhythm of oscillation.

It's a machine-centered world focused on the optimization of technology and equipment.

The work we are doing here, and the work that is **VITAL** if we hope to figure out how we're not going to go extinct, is a human-centered world—where the focus is on the optimization of human alertness and performance.

Linearity is M-F and 9-5.

Oscillation is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

Machine-centered: blue pill

Human-centered: red pill

***How to Oscillate Your Focus:***

Spend 30 minutes on focused, undistracted work that's meaningful to you, then step away from it.

Completely shift your attention and focus on renewal, something that allows you to take a rest and is rejuvenating. Starting at your screens on your devices is never rejuvenating. Leave the phone inside and go outside for 5 minutes.

Then go back to work for 30 minutes.

***How to Strengthen and Renew Your Energetic Muscles:*** **(Broad Strokes)**

**Physical:** Exercise and eat right and give adequate recovery.

**Emotional:** Join a Meetup group or Toastmasters. Leave your phone in the glove box of your car.

**Mental:** This deals largely with concepts and symbols. Increase your capacity to do focused, undistracted work. Give adequate renewal. Buy a puzzle and focus it on for 10 minutes after an hour of focused attention on your devices. Seeking renewal and rejuvenation by watching personal development videos on YouTube is not renewal and rejuvenation.

**Spiritual:**

Find out what motivates you.

Discover the values of integrity, commitment, and honesty

When you want to argue or assert your opinion, stop and ask, ""What do I really believe here?""

Become less preoccupied with your fears and concerns and start doing things for others.

4. Small Steps, Constant Progress: Don't wait for a huge leap. Make tiny, consistent efforts every day toward your goals. Little steps add up to big wins.
5. Be Great at a Few Things: Focus on mastering what truly matters instead of being average at everything.
6. Financial Freedom First: Always make money choices that build long-term independence. Keep debt low, save consistently.
7. Choose Your Circle Wisely: Spend time with people who challenge and inspire you. Avoid negativity when you can.
8. When Things Go Wrong, Adjust: Don't quit when you hit a bump. Figure out what went wrong and tweak your plan.
9. Learn by Doing, Expect Mistakes: You learn best by trying things. Don't fear mistakes; they're your best teachers.
10. Give More Than You Take: Be generous with your time, knowledge, and kindness. It makes your life, and the world, better.

These aren't secrets, but following them consistently has been key to my disciplined life.

fi82qo,"What happens when you eventually have to do things that are less stimulating? Can you open a book and read it for half an hour without doing anything else? 

Many times, this sounds unappealing, difficult or even boring, so you start indulging in playing video-games or watching your favourite series on Netflix, and before you now it – a couple of hours have already passed, so you quickly start to finish your task for tomorrow and stay up late, only to wake up tired the next morning and repeating the cycle.

You are probably very aware that these hard activities bring value to your life, and the others just momentary pleasure, so why do you still gravitate towards them?

To understand this, we need to look at a neurotransmitter known as **dopamine**.  

Dopamine is about what might, what's going to happen in the future; that's potentiality. It’s these abstract ideas about things that don’t exist yet, leading us to dopaminergic pleasure and making us feel excited, enthusiastic and energised. 

In a study published in 2009 by the Journal of Behavioural Neuroscience rats were implanted with electrodes and put in a compartment with a single lever, when the rat eventually pulled the lever, they immediately gave a stimulus as a reward to the rat’s brain, the rat would pull the lever for hours just to get this reward system, completely addicted and refusing to drink, eat or even sleep. This demonstrates the danger of too much high dopamine.

In a corollary experiment, researchers blocked the reward system of the rats. This made them completely lethargic, unable to even get up to drink water or eat food. Only if placed directly next to their mouth, demonstrating the necessity of dopamine.

**This is why people addicted to something find it so hard to quit and adapt to a normal life,** they’re used too dopamine levels that are so high, that they become like the rats who are not motivated to do anything.

# 1. Dopamine Detox

So, is there anything you can do to overcome high dopamine rushes? To help you overcome addictions, you need to perform a dopamine detox. The key is to slowly remove these highly addictive behaviours and do other things. 

To start off a dopamine detox, to pick a day in the week to avoid all the highly stimulating activities. Let your mind be at peace and let it recover from the constant high levels of dopamine.

People will go to amazing lengths just to fill up silence. When’s the last time you sat in silence to experience your own thoughts?  

When you are walking around, in public transport or in the elevator – your first intention might be to grab your phone and browse your e-mail, messages, social media – searching for dopamine. 

So, you need set a day aside**, without your internet, phone, computer, music and junk food.**

You can exercise, walk, meditate, write, study, read a book, clean your room, have a good conversation with your friends or family.

I know that this is not easy, you will soon begin to crave the addictive behaviours you’ve been doing for years, but radical actions lead to radical results.

What you need to do is connect more dopamine releases to activities that benefit you: exercising, reading a book – serving as an incentive to give you long-term benefits. 

Using a high dopamine activity can be added as a reward for completing difficult work.

So, track all the low dopamine activities that you do: cleaning your room, reading a book, working, exercising. And **after completing them**, reward yourself with some high dopamine activity.

Say, you’re at work and you start browsing social media, or playing a mobile game in the break, or constantly checking your text messages – all this stimulates your brain and makes it more difficult to concentrate on your work, you aren´t going to feel like doing low dopamine work since you aren’t motivated.

That is why you should first complete the low dopamine work and then indulge in high dopamine activities. You could do 8 hours of low dopamine and 2 hours of high dopamine, adapt this to your needs. 

Always try to not find a behaviour that is damaging such as drinking alcohol, smoking, etc., instead play a videogame, watch a series or anything else you like to do. This system allows you to control your addiction.

# 2. Combine two habits

Another tip for doing low dopamine activities is associating low dopamine with high dopamine activities. 

If you love coffee, listening to jazz or enjoy going out to the park for a breath of fresh air, combine this with another habit that you’re trying to work on. You’ll start developing a positive association of these habits, making the experience more enjoyable. 

So, every-time you go to the park, listen to jazz, drink some coffee or anything else that you enjoy doing – have a good book and begin to read a few pages. Eventually opening up a book will become more natural and enjoyable.

1fa4ml0,"I want to share with you how the book ""Atomic Habits"" has completely transformed my lifestyle. To be honest, I've always been a 'procrastinator', always thinking that change is too difficult. After reading this book, I realized I've been looking at myself the wrong way!

I started trying to define myself as 'a person with a regular lifestyle' rather than 'a person who wants to have a regular lifestyle'. This small mindset shift has had a surprising effect. For example, I now go to bed at 10 pm every night because 'this is my way of life'.

In addition, the 'environmental design' mentioned by Clear really opened my eyes. I moved the phone charger from the bedside to the living room, and the habit of staying up late to scroll on my phone miraculously disappeared.

Now I can get up on time every day, start a new day with full of energy, and after getting enough sleep, I feel more energetic in work and life, and everything feels better. These small changes have significantly improved my quality of life within two months.

I'm very curious to hear your thoughts after reading this book. Were there any points that really stood out to you? Or if you have any questions about developing habits, you can leave a message in the comments",r/getdisciplined,"After reading the book ""Atomic Habits"", I developed the habit of going to bed early, and this habit has been extremely helpful for me",1461,0.98
phiqkz,"After spending a few decades barking up the ""Willpower"" tree and failing to manufacture more of it, I decided to read a thousand pages of academic literature on discipline and impulsive behavior, and here's something interesting I found:

*(Any med students feel free to correct my clumsy summary)*

**Willpower is a twitch muscle - once it wears out it needs rest to recharge - and plays only a small part in our overall sense of discipline. Discipline is largely enabled by specific chemical pathways in the body, and there are some specific things you can change in your life that will likely boost willpower and motivation.**

*A chemical pathway is like a Plinko board on The Price is Right - a chemical is changed into something else, then something else, etc. and the path often forks as it cascades down: if the body needs to turn up a thermostat it nudges the reaction down one path, or it will turn down a thermostat by nudging it down the other path. At the end of each path there are usually receptors that turn a gene on or off to get it to create more of a specific protein - say to grow more hair, make more insulin, make you feel happy so you'll go out and kill a bison or find someone to pass on your DNA.*

**The Tryptophan-Kynurenine Pathway:**

Tryptophan is critical in balancing our system overall. You can't make it so you have to eat it, and it is converted into Serotonin (through Vitamin B6), which sets off a number of gene expressions that balance our mental health and metabolism. (diabetics often suffer from depression, and vice versa.)

When your body detects there's a problem, it will turn off that autopilot system and take hold of the wheel to manually steer itself. If you catch an illness or have a traumatic experience, the body produces inflammatory cytokines that break down Tryptophan before it can be diverted into Serotonin, dumps it down the Kynurenine Pathway, and steers it in a direction that makes you want to crawl into a cool, dark cave and stay away from other people, so you can heal up and not get anyone else sick. So it depresses the central nervous system (specifically the prefrontal cortex, where your executive function arises) along with the regions of the hippocampus and amygdala that make you want to go out and use your body for things - sensing, smelling, playing, sexing. It also turns off your sensitivity to insulin, so you burn through your energy stores more slowly.

*(side note: if your tryptophan level is suddenly depleted beyond a certain critical level, the body can produce suicidal urges. Suicide is often a battle against something the body is doing to you, and not just someone wussing out and deciding not to live anymore.)*

Once the body feels you're in a safe space and ready to go back out, it dumps Tryptophan down the other side of the pathway and increases the activity of these regions of the brain, kicks off the creation of new neural tissue and branching, and tells your metabolism to burn through the reserves necessary to fuel this process.

This oversteering is a good thing - otherwise you'd react to life like a snail. But problems arise when the switch is permanently flipped one direction. And chronic inflammation does that.

Constant stress from a job you hate, financial problems, insecurities and unresolved traumas - all keep this switch turned on, which worsens all these problems, which becomes a self-reinforcing cycle. A diet full of processed, inflammatory junk, a smoking habit, air pollution, or the low-grade inflammation that comes with obesity (or even tooth decay) all keep this switch turned on. Over time you become severely insulin-resistant, chronically depleted of serotonin, your prefrontal cortex just shuts off, and the tissue in your hippocampus and amygdala erodes.

**Then you go on subs like this and look for ways to manufacture more willpower. It ain't gonna happen, bud. You're farting at a hurricane.**

So what do to:

* Take Vitamin B Complex - B6 enables more Tryptophan to metabolize into Serotonin before it's kicked down the chute, and B12 and Folate are critical cofactors in a few other related processes.
* Take fish oil capsules, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and eat a lot of fresh green vegetables. This helps neutralize the inflammatory cytokines like IDO that kick off the pathway. I'll throw kale in the blender with fresh fruit and a little water. Blend the hell out of it until it's smooth.
* Get any underlying mental health conditions treated. If you have trauma, find an EMDR practitioner. Bipolar disorder causes the autopilot to go haywire; mood stabilizers tamp it down. Depression is like a lead foot on the brake pedal.
* Get some damn sleep. This is life-or-death. Set an alarm every night to turn screens off, then another alarm an hour after that to jump into bed no matter what. It's during sleep that the CNS flushes out the neurotoxic inflammatory byproducts it creates during the day.
* Spend $150 on an air purifier with both a charcoal and HEPA filter. Don't buy a cheap one; also buy a year's worth of replacement filters and change them on schedule. Air pollution and allergies are a huge contributor to inflammation and poor sleep.
* Find a tribe that will get you out of the house and doing physical, enjoyable activity. This gets other parts of the brain motivating us - our social drives, pleasure drives, the urge to repeat positive memories and move our bodies and sense things. This is what our species was meant to do - willpower is a second-to-last resort (*before panic, which is the procrastinator's fallback,*) when none of the other parts of the brain are motivating us. This activity fires up the brain, reduces inflammation, and gets a number of other processes going so the microglia that produce those inflammatory cytokines don't feel like the last soldiers on the battlefield, and they cool the hell down. *(side note: studies show the remedy for addiction and other compulsive behaviors is social connection, not guilt and a reliance on willpower.)*
* Find a creative activity you can do. Any higher-order activity that forces your brain to form new neural connections - especially cross-hemispheric connections - breaks you out of the circular, ruminating thoughts of self-preservation and signals to the brain that conditions are safe again, and that it should start regenerating the brain tissue it chewed up.
* Use your limited willpower to establish one new positive habit at a time. Get your emotions out of this and don't crap on yourself when it isn't perfect. Just see your willpower as one of many resources and deploy it in small increments. After a month or two when the neural pathway for that new routine is strong and established, you'll free up your willpower to be used somewhere else.

If you read all the way to the end, give yourself a cookie. I'll make another post when my undisciplined brain gets around to it.

Does anyone else feel like they’re losing self-confidence in their achievements as they age?  

As I grow older, I feel like my chances of achieving something significant have diminished. When I was younger, I had broader dreams and more ambition. But as I age, I’ve started losing confidence in my ability to achieve anything extraordinary. Now, it feels like my destiny is to work a 9 to 5 job that doesn’t have any real impact.  

When I was 11, I would open advanced physics books full of complex, mysterious concepts, and I was excited to learn more. I knew I was young and didn’t understand it at the time, but I was confident that as I got older, I would. It felt thrilling to think that one day I would master it, just like adults did.  

But as I grew older, I realized there was so much to learn, and school forced me to focus on good grades rather than true curiosity. There were so many subjects to cover that I never had the chance to explore anything deeply. In school, the material was structured into grades—this is for grade 1, this is for grade 2 and I never went beyond what was required.  

This structured learning system slowly killed my childhood curiosity. If a teacher said, this is for the next grade, I didn't see a point of reading more. I only studied what I was told to, and rarely explored beyond that. 

Now, at work, when I look around at people who were better in school and achieved more than I did, I feel like maybe I was never destined to be extraordinary. Even if I want to improve or become an expert at something now, it feels like my chances are slim because people who was going beyond the topic are  ahead of me now. And thats killing my self confidence.

It feels like I’ve missed opportunities and didn’t try hard enough when I had the chance. As an adult, I’m less confident. It seems like everyone else has outpaced me, and at some point, I was running too slow without even realizing it.  Now I feel like it was my destiny to be average, and the race is over.  

Even when I try to dedicate myself to improving or upskilling, I feel bad about it. As an adult nearing 30, I feel like I should have a more outgoing lifestyle and don't study like a kid. It feels like I’m still in school.  

The people around me who are more successful don’t need to study anymore. They gave it their all during college and are now enjoying the fruits of their labor. Meanwhile, despite all the time I spent studying, I ended up average. I feel like I’ve landed in adulthood still needing to study just to keep up, while others who were high achievers are now living fulfilling lives.  

I was the best student at school, but after going to college and then entering the workforce, I realized that the world is much bigger than my school. I began to notice that even though I was the best in my college, on a global scale, I’m very average despite putting a lot of time and effort into studying.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Like when you were younger, you believed the world was yours, and you’d be someone important, but now as an adult, you’re disappointed because you’re just average, and it feels like you did something wrong?

a8eex2,"Being alone, and especially *feeling* alone, can severely undermine your ability to self-regulate. Focusing on connecting with others in order to form deep and lasting relationships is a path to strengthened self-discipline, among many other resiliencies and improvements. Having a healthy social life that relieves you from the stress of loneliness can significantly improve your ability to manage your emotions and your life in general. I know most methods here are focused on solitary methods, but please don't forget the scientifically-proven results of social health on not only your overall well-being, but you ability to control yourself, as well. There are tremendous benefits to being socially well-connected, both in terms of self-discipline and productivity, as well as quality and enjoyment of life. It's hard to overstate the benefits.

A few examples of published research to support this comes from the book **Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection** by Dr. John Cacioppo. 

&#x200B;

**One such study** is ""Lonely traits and concomitant physiological processes: the MacArthur social neuroscience studies"" (J.T. Cacioppo et al. International Journal of Psychophysiology 35 (2000) 143􏰅154, full text available online, \~400 citations). 

In this study, three groups of participants, all of whom were right-hand dominant and therefore left-brain dominant, were surveyed and sorted into a group that felt very lonely, a group the felt socially well-connected, and a group that felt in between. 

They were then subjected to a test called dichotic listening, in which distinct sounds were pumped into either the right or left ear, which correspond to the left and right side of the brain, respectively. When asked to listen and identify sounds on their dominant side, all three groups did about equally well.

Then were asked to focus on their less dominant side, which required them to exert a great deal of executive control to filter out sounds from their preferred dominant side. In this task the well-connected and in-between groups did well, but the lonely group did significantly worse. The lonely group was less able to apply conscious control, and so suffered an attention deficit. Their ability to apply self-discipline was compromised. (The study, and many cited, supplies ptentional biologically bases for these results such as increasing stress hormone in chronically lonely people.)

&#x200B;

**In another study,** the effects of perceived future loneliness was correlated with executive brain functions. ""Effects of social exclusion on cognitive processes: anticipated aloneness reduces intelligent thought."" It's been cited 869 times (!) according to Google.  (J Pers Soc Psychol. 2002 Oct;83(4):817-27)

In this study, three groups of participants were given the same set of personality questionnaires to fill out. The actually results didn't matter, it was just a ploy to build confidence in the participants. They were then each individually given bogus results according to their group, regardless of their actual scores. Individuals from the first group, labeled Future Belonging, were told they were going to be lucky in their social life, and have many fulfilling relationships. Those in the second group, called Future Alone, were told they were going to have disastrous social lives and end up alone. The third control group, labeled Misfortune Control, were told they would be accident-prone and would likely endure all kinds of physical difficulties, which was bad news, but had nothing to do with their social future (hence why it was the control group).

They were all then asked about their mood. Despite the bad news, the Future Alone group reported no apparent emotional distress, which suggested their performance on the next test wasn't a result of being flustered.

Thus primed, they all took a portion of the GRE that covers math, spacial reasoning, and verbal ability. The Future Alone group scored worse in both speed and accuracy than the Future Belonging. More significantly, they also scored significantly worse than the Misfortune Control. This indicates that it wasn't just bad news that destroyed their executive functioning, but that the news made them feel more likely to be alone. This was enough to significantly reduce their self-regulation, specifically the ability to think straight.

Further tests were done on the groups. When it came to simple tasks and rote memorization, the Future Alones showed no impaired performance. When it came to logic problems, however, the Future Alones attempted the fewest number of problems, and on those they did attempt, they made the most mistakes. This indicates it's the higher-functioning of the brain, including self-regulation--which drives self-discipline--which is impaired by even the threat of social isolation. 

**In an additional study,** ""a brain scan conducted while subjects performed moderately difficult math problems confirmed that the brains of the socially excluded participants were less active in the same areas related to executive control that, as in the dichotic listening task, allow is to maintain focused attention."" (Soc Neurosci. 2006;1(2):124-34. doi: 10.1080/17470910601035160)

**These are just a few specific examples**, however. There are many other scientific studies showing both the correlation and the likely causal relationships between loneliness and self-discipline, among many other health factors. Anyone looking to gain resiliency and improve their self-mastery should make it a priority to improve their social connections, particularly in regards to forming deep relationships based on mutual trust and vulnerability, since it is those serious relationships which do the most to alleviate feelings of loneliness.

Here are the 6 tips:

**1. Nix big meetings**

""Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get \[out\] of all large meetings, unless you're certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.""

**2.Ditch frequent meetings too**

""Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.""

**3.Leave a meeting if you're not contributing**

""Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren't adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.""

**4.Drop jargon**

""Don't use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don't want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.""

**5.Communicate directly, irrespective of hierarchy**

""Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the 'chain of command'. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere.

""A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is allow free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen.""

**6.Follow logic, not rules**

If following a 'company rule' is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation, such that it would make for a great Dilbert cartoon, then the rule should change.""",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] Elon Musk’s 6 productivity rules from a letter he sent to Tesla employees,1445,0.94
cao7dy,"Last year I made a [post about huge life transformation with my friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/9xor1h/method_sep_8th_3_am_a_crushing_pain_in_my_chest/) /u/martincharvat. Because of the overwhelming response we formed a discipline group for redditors a few weeks after. Six months later we have a 12-week training program based on the knowledge we gained from our experience and from the experience of others in the group.

It doesn't cost any money. Everyone pays with effort.

This is what /u/kirkwoodB said about the training program after five weeks.

>*What changed for me the most was slowly becoming used to waking up early. Prior to joining, I would wake up 30minutes before work (7:30am) and would be in a constant state of panic. Rushing to get to work, working until 5pm and then being too burnt out to do anything after. On the weekends I would find myself sleeping in until 10, sometimes noon if I was out too late! I felt like I was drifting through life.  I wasn’t able to do what I wanted to do.*   
>  
>*Upon joining, I learned to create important habits to help me get to the life I wanted to live. I started waking up earlier and earlier to the point where I am usually up and ready to go at 5am. This has caused me to have more time to go to the gym as well as getting a chance to find time to write when I have the most energy. I no longer have the excuse of being too drained after work to not draw or write.*   
>  
>*I am truly thankful I happened across the 6am club group. It may have been one of the toughest things I have done but I feel like I have a direction and goals for the first time in my life.* 

It is twelve weeks because throughout the last two years we identified three habits which kickstarted us from being stuck. And we also realized that the only way how to create new habits (sustainably) in our lives is adding them one by one.

When we were started two years ago we were waking up around noon so we knew we need to get our shit together and start waking up at 6 am to get those six hours back. Now we wake up at 5 am for a few months. This is how we did it and how the program works:

1. At the beginning we took the time we were able to get up easily because in the past we were not be able to shift from 10 am to 6 am overnight.
2. Then we got up 10 minutes earlier every day until we reached 6 am.
3. We started to wake up at 6 am even on weekends because when we had not, we failed on Monday (we couldn’t fall asleep on Sunday and were deprived on Monday).
4. We send the proof to each other so we can’t bullshit ourselves. If we let ourselves to wake up a few minutes later on Monday, it would become an hour by Sunday.
5. We track everything with Google spreadsheet so we are motivated with green successful days and we make sure reds are not left unnoticed.
6. From our experience only people who feel the pressure to sort themself up make valuable teammates. So we try to surround ourselves with people who deliver. We thought it will work with our friends but it didn’t. They got easily excited but the urge to do it wasn't there. Lesson learned. So we formed the discipline group with redditors we didn't know. Around 35 redditors tried it. It worked for those who delivered. We learned a lot. So we pushed it to the next level and created a training program out of it. Another 25 redditors tried it as well. And again it worked for those who delivered. Again we learned a lot.

So here we are. Opening ten new slots for redditors to enter.

If you feel you need to change yourself otherwise you or your relatives will suffer by your decay, you have the right mindset to apply (just let us know in the comments you want in).

We will start in a few days.

* **I can be hooked on anything** Your brain has a “drug of choice.” It doesn’t have to be alcohol or drugs. It could be NSFW videos, food, work, or social media - whatever gives you the biggest (and most immediate) dopamine spike.
* **I always pay for the high** Pleasure and pain in the brain are balanced. Every time you chase a quick hit of pleasure, it pushes back with pain. Do it too often and you end up anxious, numb, and in ""dopamine deficit"" (or in my case, with ""popcorn brain"")
* **The modern world is engineered for addiction** We evolved for scarcity. Now everything is abundant and “drug-ified”: Ultra-processed food. Endless feeds. Instant gratification at our fingertips.

**What I changed:**

* **Be ok with being uncomfortable while ""single tasking"":** this is the hardest thing for me - but when I'm stressed, or feeling ""blocked"" on a task, or tired - I feel myself wanting to reach for the cheap high (which most of the time is my phone)- now I try to sit through it, or do something like a walk outside to reset - it's been a huge help for productivity and staying on task
* **Set strict boundaries with my phone:** If there's a way to get into a mindless social feed or cheap dopamine from my phone I'll find it. I decided to lock my phone down completely with strict rules where I can only open social media (and all distracting apps) 3 sessions per day - use an app to prevent all the usual workarounds 
* **Notice all potential addictions as escapes:** I am guilty of replacing one thing with another - so I watch closely and write it down at the end of the day - the things I try to fill my addictive personality with. For now I only allow myself to read physical books, or walk outside when I feel the urge to reach for something as a quick mental fix

**The results have been wild:**

* Productivity is off the charts 
* My ""battery for displipline"" is charged - I actually have the power to decide
* I get more done in 2 days than I used to in the whole week
* I can feel myself starting to enjoy simple things more
* Screen time is down like 4 hours a day on my phone

Sometimes I think it just takes a few small wins to build momentum and that's what's happening for me right now. Hoping to ride this wave and keep getting better.

11njinl,"I've posted my story on this page after 6 months and 12 months before and had a really positive response, so some of you might be interested in my 2 year report. If you'd rather watch this as a video, check out my profile.

My life is unrecognisable now to the life I had 2 years ago. I am in a great and steady relationship, I have started a good career, I exercise 6 times a week (marathon next month!), I've started playing a sport, I read daily, I study Spanish and I still balance a social life and crap Netflix shows and putting the bins out on a Tuesday.

The life I live now is one I would have dreamed of 2 years ago. I have always wanted more discipline, more motivation and more sticktoitiveness but no matter what I tried I would always fall back into old habits.

I was motivated to delete my social media because I felt like my usage was denying me of *something*. Apart from time, I wasn't quite sure what I felt like I was missing. But I realised I was falling behind. I wasn't exercising, my mental health was in bits, I had a job I didn't like and I had no goals. 

I got anxious about deleting my social media because I felt like I would fall off the face of the earth. I felt like everyone would forget me and I would become a recluse. This anxiety made me put off the decision to delete it for a long time, but eventually, in February 2021 I got rid.

The first month was amazing, I had clarity of thought for the first time in a while, and I felt like I had waaaay more free time. I also felt accomplished that I managed to take the plunge into deleting it and that sense of accomplishment made the first month awesome.

During the second and third months, things became complicated. For so long social media had been a form of escapism for me. I would quite literally numb my brain with content whenever it felt bad. I  would scroll to forget a bad day, scroll to reduce the anxiety of an upcoming test and scroll to ignore the feelings of loneliness.

Taking away my self-medicated scrolling meant that for the first time in... well forever, I had to confront these discomforts head-on. I had to endure the discomfort of being bored, the agony of being lonely and the emptiness of a bad day at work. 

Being forced to confront these unpleasant feelings became a motivation for tackling them. My brain didn't want to feel bad, so it found ways to cope with it. It started to find exercise rewarding, and it started to value and appreciate hard work. The things that I was unable to stick to for so long, I was now drawn to. My brain craved the dopamine release of social media, but since it couldn't get that it replaced it with the dopamine release of socialising, and exercising, and reading and trying new things.

Over time, these benefits had compounding interest and my self improvement progress skyrocketed. The best part is, I am 2 years into this journey and I don't feel like I'm slowing down. I cannot wait to report back next year.

c1nsc4,"DISCLAIMER: This text is from another post on reddit in another, unrelated sub - but the text is very relevant for someone trying to build discipline. [Link to original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/c18wvd/the_90_day_reset_why_it_works_and_how_you_used_it/) by /u/mrnatoo that you can read for more info/advice/original source, however it was written with a different focus/context if you decide to do so.

I think this kind of knowledge of your brain is important in order for you to actively combat your urges.

This might be inaccurately flaired as advice - maybe [Info] would be more correct, but such a flair doesn't exist.

**I have tried to highlight/make the text bold for most important areas** if you don't want to or have time to read the whole thing, kind of like a TL;DR.

**Key text:**

""During an urge, the limbic system of the brain actually sends chemicals to cloud out the frontal cortex of the brain where rational thinking is done. If you get an urge, it’s almost impossible to use a new learnt skill. Your brain’s main job is to keep you alive. Not successful, or happy, or even healthy.
How it does this is by constantly creating equilibrium or balance in our environments.

An example of this is when someone smokes. Initially, the body resists the chemicals that come with tobacco.

But because most people don’t listen to their bodies when they smoke, the brain eventually says: All right, it looks like we are going to have to deal with all of these chemicals, so let’s create equilibrium with them”. The brain deals with it, and learns to survive.

**When the person decides to quit, the brain says: Whoa! Wait a Minute, We Want Our Old Chemicals… The body and brain will then do everything in it can to restore that balance. Creating all kinds of emotions, anxiety, craving, depression, fear, you name it, the body and brain will throw it out there to get things back to normal. And if the person resists the emotions long enough to get through, the brain will eventually create a new equilibrium in line with the new environment.**

It’s this period that keeps most people from success. They attempt to change, and their brain resists it. When they run into the emotions of resistance, they go back to the old behaviour, even though they know it not what they want.

[...]

See, change is dangerous to the brain. The brain fears the unknown. It would rather keep things the same than have to figure out how to survive in a new environment. The feeling of fear, when we try to change our behaviour, is very real, it is the same chemical experience as that of being chased by a lion.

The only way people usually make it through the change, is if there is something very painful pushing them forward. The brain is wired to avoid pain and seek pleasure. That’s why if there is a strong enough reason to change, people will. Sometimes it’s ED, PIED, or a separation, loss of a job, failed exam, failed dreams that are strong enough motivators

**Brain Studies show: If you introduce a new thought, with emotion every day for about 30 days, it creates a new neural pathway in the brain. If you continue to reinforce the new thought with emotion for about 90 days, it becomes the primary neural pathway. The other way to get through is to continue to reinforce the new belief system long enough for it to take hold in the brain. This is what the brain studies have shown: Whenever you think a thought with emotion, it releases chemicals into the body. If you introduce a new thought, with emotion every day for about 30 days, it creates a new neural pathway in the brain.**

**[In other words, you have to change your behaviour and not to give in to your urges for 30 days to create a new neural pathway in the brain].**

It becomes a new habitual thought pattern in the brain. This is how you get through the urges. You continue to reinforce the new emotions until they take hold.

**And the studies also show that if you continue to reinforce the new thought with emotion for about 90 days, it becomes the primary neural pathway. Or on a cellular level, it becomes who you are.**

**[In other words, if you change your behaviour and not give in to your urges for 90 days, it becomes the primary neural pathway].**

You can create lasting change in your life, but you have to know how to work with the machine that you have. You need to learn to understand how your brain works, and how to get what you want from it. If [you continue to do something for] 30 days, it creates a new neural pathway for this habit and if they continue for 90 days, this habit becomes a primary neural pathway in their brain. They literally get wired to keep repeating this habit.""",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] How your brain is wired to actively resist as you try to build discipline,1431,0.99
brw5qg,"When I was young, I went after what I wanted with curiosity, boldness and joy.

Life was effortless and fun.

Sometimes I’d struggle to fall asleep at night because I couldn’t wait to see what the next day held.

Then something changed.

Life became serious.

It was no longer a game.

Suddenly everything was measured by grades, milestones and goals I needed to achieve.

The curiosity, boldness and joy with which I had approached each day with was replaced with conformity, doubt, and anxiety.

I struggled.

I procrastinated.

I stopped enjoying life.

Worst of all, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong with me.

Was I too lazy?

Was I too stupid to really get it?

Was I lacking the drive to succeed?

My questions lead me to search for strategies and tools to fix my laziness and give me motivation, discipline and confidence.

And boy did I find strategies. Shiny, step-by-step, guaranteed-to-work strategies. They were everywhere.

Tony  Robbins, Tim Ferriss, Zig Ziglar, Dale Carnegie and a thousand others  were all too eager to sell me their strategies and advice.

Thus began my life as a self-improvement junkie.

I spent years, thousands of dollars and countless hours trying to get myself to be who I thought I should be.

Yet for all the work I put in, I had precious little to show for it.

For  all the effort, I felt like a hollow, two-dimensional cutout of someone  I was trying to emulate rather than a genuine flesh-and-blood version  of me.

I still struggled.

I still procrastinated.

One day, as I was trying to figure out what was wrong with me for the 837th time, it hit me:

**I had bought into other people’s ideas and had lost all sight of who I was and what my own wisdom was telling me.**

In  that moment, I realized that the problem wasn’t more or better  information and strategies, because how preciously little of what we’ve  learned in our lives do we actually apply?

**The real problem seemed to be that despite everything we read and thought, what we actually struggled with was taking action.**

The fact is that almost everyone knows what they should do, it’s just that they don’t want to do it.

And boy did that describe me painfully well.

Fortunately, I was able to hear my wisdom whisper something to me:

*“Antti, why aren’t you having fun? Don't you think you would do better if you had fun?”*

It’s  hard to put into words just how much those questions changed me. It’s  like I had bought into the misguided and totally counterproductive  seriousness of the world, and suddenly I was able to see through it.

I  started asking different questions. Instead of asking how I can be  smarter, more confident or procrastinate less, I was now more interested  in understanding what makes us lose sight of the fun and curiosity we  are born with and makes us grow serious and scared?

The  answer I kept coming back to again and again was that at some point, I  started believing what society told me about the importance of outcomes.

As a result, I stopped following my curiosity and intuition and no longer trusted in myself.

Instead,  I became fixated on the outcome, as if the ends were all that mattered  and I just had to find whatever means it took to get me there.

That made me play as if I have something to lose - that I must achieve a certain result NO MATTER WHAT.

I suppose that in retrospect it’s obvious that that’s a terrible way to approach anything, but in the moment it was revelatory.

When we give the outcome power over our happiness and emotional wellbeing, we tense up.

We start playing scared.

We lose sight of the fun and curiosity that used to propel us forward.

We start trying to avoid mistakes and play it safe.

We dread obstacles and difficult situations.

We procrastinate because we don’t want to fuck up.

Now,  there are many people in the world that believe that this sort of  emotional investment in the desired outcome is mandatory in order to  make us perform at our best. They believe that putting pressure on  ourselves is what elevates us to a higher level.

I call BS on that.

When  we are forced to do something or when we feel something important is at  stake, we no longer play naturally. Action no longer flows effortlessly  from us. Instead, we become tense and we start overthinking. We get  thrown out of whack and out of sync.

Over time, I learned to differentiate between **physical investment** (effort, work) and **emotional investment** (needing some outcome to happen).

I  learned that the more I put in the work and the less I worried about  the outcome, the more effortless and fun the process became.

I found creative solutions to all sorts of problems.

I stopped procrastinating, as if by magic.

My results soared.

Simply  by forgetting about the outcome and staying fully in the moment and  only focused on the immediate next step, I kept having fun and doing  great work.

And  when I occasionally lost sight of this and started worrying about the  outcome and constantly second-guessing if this is the best way, I  procrastinated, performed poorly, and lost all enjoyment in the process.

So how can you “convince” yourself that there really is nothing at stake when it seems like there is?

In reality, you don’t have to convince yourself.

I don’t want you to agree or disagree with this post.

I don’t want you to accept what I say or oppose it.

What I want is for you to see it for yourself.

It’s all that matters.

My wisdom is useless unless I can point you in a direction where you can see a glimpse of it for yourself.

You might have rent to pay, a business to fund or an exam to pass. They all sure seem serious and real.

After all, everyone knows success leads to happiness, wealth leads to security, and circumstances dictate our experience.

**But what if we have that backwards?**

**What if happiness actually leads to success, security leads to wealth and our thoughts create our experience?**

When you see the magnitude of this for yourself, you will see that your procrastination is created from the inside-out.

So are your attempts to overcome the procrastination.

You’ve pitted one thought (*“Do something!”*) against another thought (*“I don’t want to!”*)

You are the source of both those thoughts. As you strengthen one, you also strengthen the resistance in the other.

It’s an unwinnable war, no matter how strong-willed you are.

It is only when you take a step back and realize it’s all made of thought that you can stop messing with it and making it worse.

If I had to put this in the form of advice for my former self, this is what I would say:

Hey buddy, slow down.

You’re okay.

Just relax a little.

Stop doubting yourself.

Stop pushing yourself to do and be more.

You are already enough.

This world needs YOU, not the you that you’re trying to be.

You  have so much doubt, expectations and overthinking filling your head  that the quiet, gentle voice of your wisdom is being drowned out.

*Anyone* would procrastinate in your situation.

*Anyone* would make poor decisions.

*Anyone* would stop enjoying life.

You see, procrastination isn’t a “you problem”; it’s part of the human condition.

Just  like trees flower, humans think. We’re thinkers, and sometimes we get  so caught up in our thinking that we lose track of what’s what.

Everybody gets stuck when they have too much thinking about the outcome and what we should be and achieve.

So let yourself off the hook.

Let your thoughts settle and you will automatically find your way back to clarity, resilience and wisdom.

The answer isn’t to try harder, to seek further, to beat yourself up more.

It’s the opposite.

Embrace yourself as you are.

Forget the story you’ve told yourself about procrastination, outcomes and the world.

They’re just that - stories.

Instead, just let things be as they are.

When you relax, you will notice a funny thing happen:

You’ll suddenly notice yourself having fun and being curious and taking action effortlessly again.

Just like when you were young.

You see, you never lost that innocence or that potential.

You never became lazy or serious.

You just thought you did.

If you want to improve your diet, mood, and well-being, this is one of, if not the most beneficial thing you can do for yourself alongside regular exercise.

ta7e88,"**CREATE A SECRET IDENTITY**

Want to bypass your limitations quickly? Create a secret identity.

It worked for Beyonce and many top athletes. It may just as well work for you.

Your Alter Ego can help you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to be in an instant.

**WHY AN ALTER EGO?**

Creating an alter ego is about

\- lifting your current ego limitations

\- giving voice to a different side of you.

Unfortunately, many cringe a little when they hear ‚fake it till you make it”.

The problem is our egos often stand in the way of who we want to become.

Sure, it has some bad rep, but if you’re looking for a way to surpass your limitations temporarily, I would highly recommend learning this tactic.

**THE HOW OF CREATING AN ALTER EGO**

So far, the most eloquently put version of this practice is The Alter Ego Effect by Todd Herman.

You create an alter ego – or a persona – that you want to show up in a particular area of your life. Think of it as a costume you want to don.

**THE STEPS**

1. Decide why you want an Alter Ego and which area of your life you want it to show up.
2. List the qualities of your Alter Ego you feel emotionally connected to.
3. Create a detailed image of your Alter Ego (it can be a person but also an animal that has certain qualities)
4. Give your Alter Ego some background- The Heroic Origin Story
5. Pick a name.
6. Find an artifact that will help you activate your Alter Ego when you need it - think of it as a micro version of a full costume (pair of glasses, a ring, or a cape!)

Creating an Alter Ego is a simple yet powerful way of tapping into your hidden potential and bypassing many of your limiting beliefs.

It’s always a good idea to have friends with superpowers, so why not create your secret ally that can show up in different areas of your life and act on your behalf in a way you may otherwise find difficult?

**PLEASE NOTE: Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a psychological condition and not a choice; creating an Alter Ego is a choice and meant to be used as a tool. Do not confuse the two** 😊

Then something shifted.

One night, I just sat there and thought: I’m gonna die one day. Not in a dramatic way, just the simple truth. No one’s gonna remember me in 100 years. I’ll be gone. Everything I’m stressing over right now won’t matter at all. And weirdly, that gave me peace.

So I started asking myself one question every single night: If I died tonight, would I be proud of how I lived today?

That question hit differently. It didn’t make me want to push harder or be perfect. It made me want to be real. To live with more intention. To stop bullshitting myself. To stop scrolling through days like they’re infinite.

Since then, I’ve been showing up in a whole new way. Not just with habits, but with how I talk to people, what I say yes to, how honest I am. I’m still figuring it out, but something feels different now. Less pressure. More purpose.

Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

# 2/Learn. 

Learn is your best tool to grow. Develop your ability to learn. 

Not just the programs offered by the company. But anything that attracts your curiosity and can help both you and your team.

Reading is a growth booster. And it has helped me tremendously in the professional world. 

Mr. Covey's 7 Habits supported me as a salesman and still guides me today as an executive. 

# 3/Develop your productivity. 

Because everything is moving so fast, your organization becomes crucial. 

When we talk about productivity, we often think of applications, techniques, but they are only part of the equation and not the most important. 

The 4 essential productivity keys in business

**a. Start with the big picture and keep it in mind.**   
What do you want to do professionally? If everything was possible, what would you do? 

I still have a mind map I made over 20 years ago. It described my professional options. And at the time, it looked crazy.   
Guess what?   
I met and exceeded all my expectations. Maybe I should have thought bigger 😀. 

What you do today has nothing to do with what you can become tomorrow. 

**b. Learn to sleep well.**   
Professional life is exhausting. To be lucid, to make the right choices, you need to be rested and full of energy. Sleep is your best ally. I wish I had understood this earlier. 

**c. Learn to recover in a hostile environment.**   
""As soon as I close this project, I'll slow down."" 

There's no such thing. 

The business doesn't slow down. It's getting faster and more complex. You must learn to recover in this environment.

The key is to block out time in your schedule only for you and non-negotiable. 

Time to think or deal with a file alone, play sports at lunchtime, time in the morning to make music, write, walk....

It’s in these moments that you will recover. 

**d. The one thing that makes or kills your day**

Deciding what you will and won't do is your most important decision. 

Learning to follow through (perseverance) and bring your project to the finish line is crucial. 

We tend to start a lot and follow few...

# 4/Work on your innovation muscle.

You have to change a lot and at the same time persevere. Isn't it contradictory? 

My way of understanding it: 

I see a pattern in adopting a flexible mindset in the thought process and a consistent mind when it comes to actions.

We often associate innovation with big projects. But this is far from being the case all the time. 

To stand out, innovate every day. Train your muscle. 

Without anyone asking you to, regularly brainstorm on improvement topics. 

* 10 ideas to improve our service meetings that I can share with my boss
* 10 ideas to improve the cash collection process
* 10 ideas to get more leads....

# 5/Learn to write.

Write in your journal to analyze your problems, your emotions, to transform your fears into actions. 

Write a handwritten thank you card to a colleague, a client, a partner. 

Write to explain before a meeting the critical elements of a project and facilitate the decision-making process for the group.

# 6/Welcome your doubts. 

Complexity creates doubts. Will I be up to the task?

Doubt creates fear. 

Fear paralyzes you. 

Replace that with : 

* Cut the complexity into small pieces. 
* And take action. 

Collect feedback on your first actions and adjust, modify until you find the direction. 

Next time doubts knock on your door. Welcome them. It's not a wrong signal; it's a chance to grow.

# 7/The habit of extending your comfort zone.

A complicated case, a risky promotion, if that's what you want to do. Go for it. 

Expose yourself to risk more often. 

Practice in everyday life. You're afraid to jump from 3 meters at the pool, try it. It's a controlled risk (pool with lifeguard 😀 ) in a secured environment. 

# 8/Develop a hobby/side hustle. 

The business is moving fast. What was true yesterday won’t be tomorrow. 

A merger, an acquisition, a bankruptcy, a drop in result, no matter how good your work is, your situation can change at any time. 

Or simply a desire on your part to do something else, to give another meaning to your life. 

Don't define yourself only by your position. Find and develop passions besides your main activity. When you find something you like, invest some time. 

It allows you to distance yourself from your primary job. 

And maybe one day, you'll decide to take the plunge and launch your new idea. 

Many successful businesses started with a passion. :)  


# To sum up. 

Life in the company is challenging, full of complexity, and at the same time exciting. If you have the desire and the energy, you can develop your career, learn a lot and earn a good living. 

Enjoy the road.

I used to be so depressed in school that I didn't even bother to pay rent nor leave my apartment for 6 months. The only reason the landlord didn't kick me out was because he was a friend of my relative.

Now I'm leading an AI team, have a day job, run side projects, and have a family of my own (baby boy). The journey wasn't easy, but there are few things that got me out of the gutter. Stanford neuroscientist and professor, Andrew Huberman, recently explored these behavioral methods in his neuroscience podcast.

I decided to summarize the[ new episode](https://youtu.be/uuP-1ioh4LY?t=293) to save you 1+ hours and deepen my understanding.

Hope this helps you as much as it has helped me.

Let’s dive in.

# Get sunlight in the morning

He emphasized getting sunlight with your eyes early morning before 10 am as much as possible. That means, looking up at the sky (not directly at the sun).

* Exposure to sunlight strengthens the connection of Melanopsin cells and circadian rhythm
* You’ll feel sleepy and wake up at the right time
* Your balance of alertness and energy should be more consistent

Sunlight is key. If you bother to take a walk outside in the morning, your circadian rhythm becomes more consistent, allowing better sleep and wake up time. This was a life saver in college. The fact that I ""went out"" slowly changed how I felt and acted.

# Focus on alertness and energy

Most people try to “will” their way through. This is usually inefficient because everyone has their own daily rhythms. Instead of willpower, he encourages you to divide your day into different levels of alertness and energy. Hence, making the effort easier and more efficient.

* Are you more alert in the morning/afternoon/evening?
* Do deep work (brain intensive) when you feel the optimal balance of two
* Try boring admin work when alertness is low
* Creative work when alertness is low
   * Fun & light creative work can spark your energy to new heights or sustain it.

I do most of the deep work in the morning, between 7 to 9 am. This is when my alertness and energy are balanced to generate focus. I’m able to achieve far more in just 2 hours of time.

Around 2 pm, my alertness starts to go down. So I tend to go through emails and do some admin work without thinking.

But what if you feel sleepy after lunch to do anything? That’s his final point.

# Get NSDR (non-sleep deep rest)

Non-sleep deep rest(NSDR) or 20-30 minutes of nap can boost your alertness if done correctly.

* Yoga Nidra (20 minutes) to relax your body
* Sleep 20-30 minutes once a day after lunch
* For advanced people, you can use NSDR at the end of 90 minute batch of work/learning to boost retention and alertness

This is THE mood changer. I normally sleep 20-30 minutes right after lunch to wake myself from sleepiness. When done correctly, my mind becomes clearer and I dive right into creative work. Admin work is at the end of work day.

In terms of NSDR, it helped me learn how to code in a relatively short time period. I repeated as many 90 minute batches of learn-rest cycle. Super effective.

# Conclusion

It’s all about getting that sunlight and managing your alertness to try new things.

This makes sense. Most of us peak at different times of day. Usually, the best time to focus is 1\~2 hours after waking up, but to each their own.

Try dividing up your day’s schedule into alertness & energy levels, instead of time blocking every single minute. Most of us are not Elon Musks.

As a team lead of 6 that research AI and active learning, I use this technique to optimize my day job, side projects, and practice code. Procrastination isn't a huge issue anymore. However, most young teenagers, especially the disadvantaged youth aren’t exposed to this type of knowledge. Thus, they become less responsive and more destructive in self-sabotage.

That’s why we are planning an awareness campaign with **Stanford’s Bridging Tech to help homeless teenagers be better version of themselves with affordable devices and counseling**.

jzdxud,"In the self-improvement community, you often hear advices that often encourage pushing yourself to do more.

\- Don't like doing a task? Do it anyway

\- Have negative thoughts? Fight it back

\- Thinking of taking a break? Screw that, that's for lazy people.

There are these advices being thrown around, and it's especially rampant in motivational speeches, and many other 'surface-level' self-improvement community.

But the thing is. Self-control is an illusion. To simplify, there are two parts of you. The one being the rational, thinking, and long-term part of you, and the other is the emotional part of you.

And you may think that the one responsible for making choices in life is the thinking rational part of your brain. But that's not true. Your emotional brain is the one making decisions.

When you say ""I want to be productive for 3 hours today"" and you were actually productive for 3 hours, that's not your rational brain making the decision. It's your rational brain convincing the feeling brain to make the decision. Similarly, when you say ""It's ok, I can play games as a reward for today."" This is thinking brain rationalizing your emotions.

In the end, your emotions dictate your decisions. And that's why forcing yourself, beating yourself up and yelling failure at yourself won't work. You'll just feel more negative emotions, which will hinder your ability to make proper decisions.

To sums things up, the more stable your emotion, the more you can make proper decisions that benefits you.

So, if coercing yourself to get things done will only result in worse results, then what should I do?

Get into emotional regulation. Learn about cognitive behavioral therapy, read a book about it, or go to see a therapist.

Procrastination is not a problem of self-control, it's a problem of emotional regulation.

I think a lot of people miss this important point. Everyone procrastinates for different reasons. Some fear success, while others fear failure. Some hate themselves, while others lack fulfillment.

There're are hundreds of self-help techniques to help with fears, guilt, sadness, loneliness, etc. But they're all problems of emotion regulation. You can have a universal technique for managing all these emotions. It's in CBT. (Look up daily record of dysfunctional thoughts)

(Reference from Everythingisf\*cked by Mark Manson)

Edit:

**What I think the difference between self-control and emotional regulation is** 

Your emotion is the one making the decision. You can think of it as your feeling brain driving the car, and you, the rational brain in the passenger seat. You can't control your direction, only convince your feeling brain to go in a specific direction.

By  regulating your emotions, you are regulating the driver so he doesn't crash or get sidetracked too much. The rational mind can be in control,  but most of the time, it's the emotional brain in control. So  'self-control' is not that accurate because you're really not in control—that's why I call it emotional regulation—because it's more accurate.

And  I think that's why we end up binging youtube for the whole day or  eating a tub of ice cream, especially if you coerce yourself by saying  'I'm lazy' or 'There's something wrong with me.' Because by doing that,  you're only making yourself more emotionally unstable, which makes the driver—your emotional brain—drives more recklessly.

But hey, that just depends on your definition of self-control. I'm only referring to the masses definition of self-control—that you need to beat your emotion to submission to be productive.",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] Self-control is fake,",1395,0.96

ps8xl4,"I’d like to share with you a practice that has been working really well for me: every evening, I clean my apartment for exactly 20 minutes - going by the clock. At the end of 20 minutes, I stop.

I’ll start by noting that I’m in a privileged position to be able to do this: I live alone, and nobody judges how clean or dirty my apartment is.

That said, there are a number of great benefits to doing it this way:

* The most obvious one is that I’m cleaning every day, but never enough to burn out on it.
* There’s always something else I could be cleaning or organizing. When I clean without a set period of time, I always end up defeated: “I want to do more, but I’m too tired / don’t have time / etc.” But when I clean for exactly 20 minutes, it’s a win: I feel victorious at the end, because I did exactly what I planned to.
* In fact, it becomes kind of a race. I’m not rushing like wild, but I’m definitely getting as much cleaning into 20 minutes as I can.
* When I stop, I’m usually seeing more things to clean. This creates a “hook” for the next day.
* Once the apartment is basically clean, I can start organizing, going through drawers, and so on. So I have a motive to keep the apartment clean during the day, because the cleaner I find it in the evening, the more of the 20 minutes I’ll be able to spend on longer-term organizing goals.

I should note that I don’t have heavy psychological resistance to cleaning. At times when I did, 2 minutes worked as a way to get started; once into it, I upped the time.

Not every practice in my life works best on a fixed-time schedule, but this one certainly does. Are there any that work that way for you?",r/getdisciplined,[Method] The joy of cleaning my apartment for EXACTLY 20 minutes each evening,1395,0.99
kituw1,"TL:DR – Having a vague notion that things will be better if you stick with your resolutions isn’t a good enough motivator for it to stick. It needs to be **crystal clear** what you are deciding on when you decide to ""get disciplined"". So here's the reality: life is all about a tradeoff of happiness versus pleasure. You can pick either a life of short moments of pleasure with an emotional backdrop of misery (our default), OR moments of short-lived discomfort with an subtle emotional backdrop of happiness. You can't have both.

&#x200B;

January 1st is coming up where we're all going to make ambitious pacts to get disciplined. We'll proclaim to the world *""This is who I want to be, and this is what I have to do—and not do—to actually be that person"".* It'll go well for a little while, then we’ll slip a little and before we know it, we'll be back to our old ways, or worst as we binge on our vices in a vain attempt at drown out our self-contempt.

We'll then tell ourselves the problem is our lack of self-control. It's our inborn apathy and a lack of motivation. Perhaps fundamentally we are flawed... damaged... simply less than the other people out there on Instagram or whatever that have their proverbial shit together.

Sound familiar? Of course, none of that is true; believe me (or believe your trained therapist who’ll tell you the same thing).

Here's the truth: breaking out of your rut will be tricky, but it is entirely possible with the right mindset, tools and support. What I've learned after struggle for 15+ years with brutal procrastination and bad habits is that **it's absolutely critical to first gain clarity as to** **what it is** **you are seeking when you promise to get disciplined.**

We tend to have this vague notion that, if I ""get disciplined"", good stuff will come and bad stuff will be avoided. Though true enough, none of that is clear, so when it comes time to make any one of the thousands of decisions that actually count—*should I eat this donut… should I watch another episode instead of exercise… should I put off starting on my work by checking Youtube*—you’ll have nothing concrete and coveted to point to, so it becomes easy and automatic to say “NO… I don’t want that basic crap. I want *this* instead…”.

In other words, on January 2nd, you'll end up rationalizing your old troublesome behavior because you'll have no clear view of what's at stake. That vague notion that things will be better if I stick with my promises won't be a good enough motivator. If it was, you would have kept last year’s resolutions. You need something better.

…

So here is what’s massively helped me gain clarity of what’s actually at stake in my life.

Start by picturing the Yin-Yang symbol.

In life, you can take either the Yin path OR the Yang path.

Our default is the Yin path (black-half with the white dot). On this path you get access to pleasures. This is represented by the white dot: little gumdrop moments of gratification; innocent distraction from the worries and stress of our lives; sweet relief from the incessant itch of craving.

But the backdrop is black. It's dark as heck.

When you’re not mindlessly inserting food in your face or urgently tapping at Reddit for a fix of fresh links, you’ll notice a background *refrigerator hum* of pain. Regret, worry, longing, craving… our unprocessed emotional pain is always there, unprocessed, un-dealt with.

The Yin is a life of pain—a reverse nightmare that starts only when you wake up off your devices and you open your eyes to reality—dotted with ephemeral, fleeting moments of pleasure and relief.

The Yang path is the opposite.

It has that white, peaceful backdrop we all seek. A clear and content mental space. A joyful and grateful temperament. The destination is not *having* this or that—it’s not even succeeding or enjoying the many fruits of success. It’s simply the blissful absence of wanting. Of being ok with what is in the here and now (and this, btw, is what opioids are notorious for simulating).

There is, however, the inevitable black dot with the Yang path. It’s discomfort.

 If you chose the path of Yang, if you want the white backdrop of happiness, you have to learn to confront and deal with black pointed moments of discomfort.

...

We all have pain in our lives. From regrets about past mistakes, to anxieties about change and loss; this is, I suppose, the grim inextricable part of the human condition.

Then there’s the optional discomfort of doing what you need to do to accomplish your goals, like putting yourself out there, stepping out of your comfort zone, and exerting yourself physically or mentally.

These are the discomforts we’ve programmed our brains to either avoid or pacify away with our vices. If we decide to step on out onto Yang path—which is what “getting disciplined” ultimately requires you to do—you are going to have to take that discomfort into your awareness, sit with it and feel it wholly. No distraction. No relief. No emotional blanky.

It’s going to be uncomfortable. It's going to sting. If your past has all sorts of trauma or let-downs, if the future is worrisome or grim, I wholeheartedly suggest you do this with a therapist.

...

The point is, you can’t have both. You can’t have a life filled with a conga-line of titillations, void of any felt discomfort, while also remaining happy and at peace. You also can't have a life of zero pleasures but also no discomfort. These are fantasies.

It’s either dots of foreground pleasure (mindlessly consumed) with background misery, OR dots of foreground discomfort (mindfully observed and managed) with a background of happiness.

Yin or Yang.

Which one will you choose?

...

Ultimately it's up to you to ponder the implications and decide. Many and most people are ok to coast with the Yin path (pleasure + misery); or at least they make it seem ok. That's fine.

But if you decide to take the Yang path (discomfort + happiness), see I urge you to do something to remember exactly what it is you are after...

...Real, enduring happiness over fake ephemeral pleasure...

...Moments of mindfully managed discomfort over the miserable hangover of procrastination and overindulging on vices. 

Perhaps draw a little Yin-Yang symbol with an arrow pointing to the white part somewhere to remind you... or do like I do and make yourself read a little reminder each day (I have actually have sheet of paper that I read as part of my morning routine).

...

If you ask me, taking and sticking to the Yang path is 10000x better and worth it, even though it might not seem like it at first. I hope for you to take it too, and more importantly, to be compassionate with yourself when you slip and find yourself back on the Yin.

If you need help with this and the process of starting up on good habits and ending bad ones, and if you like the vibe of my writing, I suggest you read the Habit Reframe Method, which I posted on this sub a while back.

z1usgt,"A few people in this sub are open about having ADHD as adults, but if you told me I had ADHD three years ago, I’d have said “but I’m not hyperactive or disrespectful!” NOPE, that’s not what ADHD is, turns out there’s an “inattentive presentation” (ADD) which means a lot of people  daydream or have many trains of thought or battle severe executive dysfunction which we call procrastination even though the inability to start an important task until the stress of the last minute is quite different than neurotypical people putting off something they don’t want to do.

muj2wg,"8 days ago I set out to eliminate three things that have been a part of my routine for the last 3+ years because I have been depressed, unproductive, and socially anxious and was looking for change.

Quitting these addictions is quite painful.

Caffeine - I had little to no energy for first 3 days without and spent most of my time sleeping. After around day 5 I no longer needed naps to get through the day.

Nicotine - I'm eating a lot more food.

Nofap - Unfortunately, I have not managed to stay clean on this addiction. The dopamine deficit of no caffeine or nicotine heightened by libido. Eventually, the urge overwhelmed me and I allowed myself to fail. I have not given up on trying to start a streak, however.

Although people advised against attacking all 3 addictions at once, I found that it actually helped. In the past, when I have quit just nicotine for example, I have found myself constantly thinking about it. By trying to quit three at once, the feeling of wanting to fap superseded nicotine and caffeine withdrawal pings. 3 for the price of 1.

My withdrawals seem to be improving but this is difficult. I am suffering. I did get a glimmer of hope when I felt more energized during sports practice than usual. The only thing that is keeping me going is the belief I will eventually feel better.

Life had been pretty hard lately, my social anxiety and depression have been severe. But life is too short to be depressed so I'm fighting back. No nicotine or caffeine for 8 days so far.

Little things like cleaning my room do not require obscene amounts of effort anymore. Exercise seems desirable to me now. I initiate conversations with friends. Writing papers, staying focused at work, and accomplishing small personal goals are all within grasp for me now just because I sought help for a medical condition.

To reiterate, please please please don't fight with yourself. It doesn't have to be this hard. If you are like me, you may feel ashamed of yourself for not being able to find the strength to accomplish things that other people do easily. Don't be ashamed. Seek help beyond an internet forum that can only provide resources. For me, it was as simple as talking to my primary care physician about how I was feeling. If that is too much for you right now, talk to a loved one and let them help you.

Edit: To all those asking, I am taking Lexapro. If Lexapro did not work for you please ask your doctor for a different option.

870y8d,"Most people want to be better.

Buy that new car because it’ll make you look good. Get that new phone because you oh-so need it.

Here’s what most people won’t do though: **actually make sure they live a life in which they can achieve that**.

Most people are dreamers and talkers, not doers and walkers. And that’s a shame. Because it’s actually **really easy to go from a dreamer to a doer.**

One of the most basic things you need to do in order to become a doer is to put great habits in your life. Habits that benefit you as a human. *Habits that make you be more grateful for the things you do.*

Because being grateful will lead to being happy. And being happy will lead to living a better life. And living a better life will lead to you actually working on the things you want to accomplish rather than being mad/sad/angry about the fact you haven’t accomplished them yet.

So, here are 17 habits that only take less than 10 minutes. I advise to not immediately put all these habits into your life. See, building great habits is about **picking up 1 good habit** and then after 14 days adding another one because you feel good about the first one. And then 10 days later - another. Another 14 days later - another.

# Why take up habits that take up less than 10 minutes?

Alright, let’s be real. The reason I have these habits in my life or have had these habits in my life is **because they don’t take much time.**

See, we all have 10 minutes in our day to make ourselves feel better. And even if you don’t think you have 10 minutes, I bet you 100% you do. So at the end of the list, **I have added some activities that you are most likely doing but of which you can spare just 10 minutes in order to improve your life** (because when you improve your life, you also improve how you do the other things you do during the day).

Again, I do not advise to take up all these habits (at once). Instead, find one that seems to fit your current lifestyle and just start doing it today - right after you read this article. Just take 10 minutes or less and start working on it right away.

# 1.  Write to someone who is your hero/mentor - takes 5 minutes

Alright, so no matter what field you are in, whether you’re in college or work full time, we all have people we look up to.

The people that have been extremely successful. Those who are our idols. **People that we believe are legends**.

Here’s a little secret about those people: **they’re actually just like you and me**. See, most of the successful people that we know and look up to used to live a life that wasn’t as good as it this today. Most of them actually got their drive from the fact that **their life was a lot worse in the past**.

These people are human, like you and me. No matter how legendary they may look in your eyes.

And it has never been easier to reach these people - it’s extremely easy nowadays.

  
Think about a person that has really helped you in your life. Whether it’s an NFL player, writer, entrepreneur, athlete, no matter who it is. Think about **HOW** they have helped you. And think about **WHY** it benefited you.

Then take those two together, the how and why, and write a short message. Then send them that message, either by email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, comment on their blog, anywhere.

**A short message of gratitude**. A message that shows them that something they did in the past - something they may have even forgotten about - that has truly benefited you in your life.

This has real benefits for yourself, but also for them. For you, it’s a great way to see how someone that you may have never met - or only met shortly - can have a huge impact on how you live and have lived your life. And it’s a good reminder of a good personality trait or habit that you picked up.

Secondly, people love it when someone is grateful for something they have once done or said. See, it’s only a simple message. You’re not asking them for an autograph, for a friend request, for something in return - except 99% of the people that reaches out to them actually does this). No, **you will be that 1%** that is actually making them feel good, that can put a smile on their face that day.

After reading Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday, I sent him a short email thanking him for writing the book. I told him what chapters resonated with me most and why they resonated with me. That’s it, no questions for him, no ‘please love me’ statement, nothing at all. And he sent me a short email back.

I now made it a habit to do this at least once a week, usually after reading something online, listening to a podcast or after finishing a book. It’s just a small gesture that shows them you respect what they have to say and can help them to find that extra boost today to do something worthwhile for others.

Sometimes I get a reply, sometimes I don’t. But I know with 90% certainty that they read it.

And maybe, one day, when you meet them (again), they will remember you. Great conversation starter.

# 2.  Meditate - takes 10 minutes

Yes, here we go again.

I know, you’ve probably read it on every blog, in tons of books, heard it on the radio.

That old hippy activity that makes you a Buddhist after doing it once: meditation.

But meditation is actually something way different than trying to think yourself towards a Buddhist life. It’s an activity that helps you to just sit down, and think about many things or nothing at all.

Eyes closed, **no focus on anything but your thoughts**. Meditation is one of the greatest habits in my life and I do it every single day.

When I first started to meditate I would just sit there. Thinking what the hell I was doing. Thoughts flashing back and forth in my mind. My thoughts were going everywhere.

And that’s ok. That’s what always happens when you start something new. You just have no idea what you are doing and how to do it well.

Then I discovered [HeadSpace](https://www.headspace.com/), an app that helps you meditate (and also really focuses on the benefits of meditation). I used it for a week, found out how to do it, and then downloaded an app called [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) to continue meditation in my own way.

At first, I would just sit still and let thoughts pass through my head and observe them. After a while, I found that I got all the benefits from it that I wanted and turned to **transcendental meditation**. This is a practice in which you repeat a 1 or 2 syllable word during a period of 10 minutes.

By doing this in the morning, I help myself to **prepare for the day mentally**. And when I don’t meditate on a day, I notice it in the other things that I do. I have better and happier days when I meditate and am planning to do it for a long time.

# 3.  Journal - takes 2x 2.5 minutes

Man, if there’s one habit that I can highly suggest putting into your life then it’s journaling.

The benefits of this habit outperform those of any other habit. Journalling is a fantastic way to start and end the day.

For a long time, I would sit down in the morning and just write down my thoughts. I’d write short stories (more about this in the next habit) to get clear my mind in the morning.

Then, after listening to the Tim Ferris Podcast, I discovered **the 5-minute journal**. It’s a pretty simple concept.

Every morning, right after you wake up, you answer 3 simple questions:

-   What am I grateful for today? 3 Answers
-   What would make today great? 3 Answers
-   A daily reminder, I am…

I used to write this on a notepad with a pen, every morning. But then I ended up ordering the book called 5 Minute Journal, which is basically a nice looking version of a notepad with the questions and a good quote at the top of the page. I think it’s about $20 online.

Then, at night, you answer another 2 questions:

-   What were 3 great things that happened today?
-   What could I have done better today?

It’s a **great way to reflect on your day** and to see what you have done today to benefit yourself or others. By doing this every day, you have **a great book filled with information about your day to day life.**

Now, there are tons of others ways to journal, and it’s obviously up to you on which one you choose to do daily. Find one that you believe fits your personality and lifestyle best and just keep doing that every single day.

# 4.  Write a short story - takes 7-8 minutes

During a period where I was homebound for a few weeks, I’d wake up every morning and just write some short story to clear my mind in the morning.

I’d write about any topic that came up in my mind the second I started writing. About how grain has been one of the most insane foods in how humans have lived their lives (from 10,000 years ago to now), how having a cold is a terrible experience, how **we remember people in the past from the wars they fought but remember people today from the greatness they have achieved**.

It didn’t really matter to me what the topic was, I just wanted to write something down and get my head cleared before I started the day. By writing for just 10 minutes, I had the opportunity to just put any thoughts I had on paper and before I jumped in the shower my head would just be calm.

The short time that I focused on writing helped the random and impulsive thoughts in my head to stop and allowed me to just sit still for a few minutes. And I benefited from this throughout the whole day because those random and impulsive thoughts wouldn’t appear in my mind as much as they would before I had that period of writing.

  
  
  

# 5.Have a good and healthy breakfast - takes 10 extra minutes

You most likely already know this, yet a lot of people either skip breakfast or just put some sugary cereal with high carb yoghurt into a bowl and eat it. **Which is a terrible way of starting your day.**

See, by just putting a little more thought and effort into your breakfast, it’s a lot easier to start your day off right. Let’s say you now put 5 minutes into preparing and eating breakfast. If you just take 10 more minutes, you allow yourself to **make a breakfast that is a lot healthier** and contains way more nutritions than your current breakfast.

In 15 minutes, you can easily prepare and eat an omelette with some veggies, meat and other ingredients that have high benefits for your health and contain the necessary amounts of fat for your brain to function well (**fat, by the way, is not bad for your health. You need fats, your brain won’t function without it** - it’s just important that you know what types of fat you need to eat).

There’s this thing called the [Bulletproof diet](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0243/9705/files/Bulletproof-Diet-Infographic.pdf?8043). Now, I don’t follow that diet (or am in any way an expert to tell you that you should) but I did learn a lot about healthy fats and the foods that contain them. I can highly suggest to look it up on Google and learn more about the foods that you can eat during the day that will benefit your body but especially your brain.

# 6.  Read 4-5 pages of a book - takes 10 minutes

Here’s probably one the best habits you can put into your life: reading.

See, we all like to read more books, especially books **that allow us to be better at whatever we are trying to be good at in life**. And it doesn’t always take reading an entire book to get a lot of knowledge from it. Most books contain so much information that a quick read of 4-5 pages will already allow you to move forward.

Now, I highly recommend reading more than just 10 minutes a day. It’s one of the most beneficial things you can do in life. But if you don’t have much time to read, it’s better to just get that 10 minutes daily. **30 x 10 minutes a day is 5 hours a month. That’s about 120-150 pages.** Depending on the book, you can easily finish half of it without dedicating a lot of time to it.

**Here’s a good trick if you want to read more books**. I’ve tried this for a while and can truly say I got a lot of it. I just stopped using it because it mainly worked with books that I had no interest in reading entirely but still wanted to get some important elements from. There’s an app called Blinkist that is perfect if you want to read books quickly. I think it’s $17 a month. This allows you to put just 10 minutes in a day to read 1 book. That’s 30 books a month.

Blinkist summarizes thousands of really good books. Books that seem interesting to you but you might not want to own, spend the $20 on or spend 2 months reading. Because the books are summarized, it’s way **easier to find the important parts of the book** without worrying that you need to read all the extra paragraphs and sentences around that information.

  
  

# 7.  Make a plan for the next day - takes 3-5 minutes

If you’re not doing this right now, I can highly recommend that you start doing it. See, by making a good plan the day before you allow yourself to be a lot more aware of the things that are coming up.

This means you are **less stressed by all the things that come onto your path the next day**, simply because you have already established a schedule for yourself in which you have noted when you are going to do the things that are on the to-do list today.

And **it’s extremely easy to do this**. Just take a few minutes at night, right down the things you need to do the next day and then schedule them throughout the day.

Every day, I now write down when I’m going to get up, when I eat breakfast, when I go to the gym, when work starts, when I write articles, etc. This never clogs up my mind since **I can dedicate the time that I work on an activity on that activity** rather than stressing myself out that I have so many other things to do that day.

# 8.  Get a night routine - takes 5-10 minutes

You most likely already know this but haven’t put it in your life yet: a good night routine.

See, night routines are essential to having a good night of sleep. You will sleep far better and have fewer worries once you have a night routine in your life. It allows you to **settle down for a bit before you actually go to sleep**.

This habit shouldn’t take too much time of your day and is extremely beneficial. Just take 3-4 short activities that make you sleep better. For me, it’s drinking some camomile tea, grab my clothes for the next day, brush my teeth and write in my journal. After that, my head is empty and I can easily fall asleep within a short amount of time.

# 9.  Track your progress in life - takes 2-3 minutes

By just putting 2-3 minutes a day into tracking your life you allow yourself to see the progress that you have made.

It’s easy to underestimate the progress you are making if you are just looking at it every day. Because where you stand today, is not where you will stand in two weeks. Yet, most likely, you will still feel the exact same.

By using apps like [Momentum](https://momentum.cc), [Today](https://neybox.com/today/) or [HabitBull](www.habitbull.com) you can track your progress every single day and see how well you are doing on that streak.

These apps allow you to basically track anything. Which means you can just set your own goals, how many times you want to do that habit every week and then note down when you have done it.

Sure, the first few days won’t be that impressive. But, after a while, **you will quickly realize you’ve been doing some specific habit for a few weeks now**. It also keeps you motivated to do that specific activity daily, as you won’t allow yourself to lose a 30-day streak. Highly motivating and it just takes a few minutes a day.

# 10.  Send a message to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while - takes 5 minutes

There’s a high probability that you have friends that you haven’t talked to in a while that kind of just disappeared out of your life. But, unless you decided to not hang out anymore because you got into a fight together, the relationship is still pretty decent.

And that’s exactly why you should **put time into contacting them**. Not only is it a nice reminder of the good times you shared with each other for yourself, it is also a great reminder for them. And a lot of times, good conversations will follow from sending this message.

Whether it’s a quick “What’s up?” or the fact they just got a new job, got married, got a kid, it doesn’t matter. In your lifetime, you will have many experiences in front of you. But **never forget about the ones in your past** - the **good memories that eventually made you the person that you are today**.

# 11.  Look up a question you want an answer to on Quora - takes 5-10 minutes

This is one of my favourites and has since then inspired me to also be a contributor to Quora.

  
See, Reddit is a great place, especially when it comes to the self-improvement subreddits (like this one, but also the ones in the sidebar). Problem with Reddit is that you mostly will check out the top posts of today, this week or this month. But sometimes **you are just looking for advice on something else**.

[Quora](https://quora.com) is a great place to just search for a question that you want to have some solid advice on. The people there have one interest: to make sure the question gets answered in the best way possible. Which means there’s a ton of free content there that you can read in order to get the best advice on any matter (alright, it’s not always the best advice, but usually the questions you have are answered in a great way or at least link to articles that will answer that question).

Either install the Quora app or just go the website and **search for questions you need advice on right now**. Whether it’s how to tell better stories, how to clean your snowboard, where to find specific items, whatever it is.

It’s a great place to get a lot of knowledge in short blocks of text and has helped me in the past to find a lot of new and interesting information that I wouldn’t have found looking through dozens of blogs that contain way too much extra information.

# 12.  Listen to Motivational Speeches on Spotify - takes 5-10 minutes

We all know it: even though those motivational speeches may sound insane from the outside, that stuff actually works when it comes to getting **yourself pumped up to do something.**

Whenever I take a cold shower in the morning, I listen to these speeches in the background. It’s a great way to get some motivation in the morning and also helps myself to push myself to actually feel that cold water.

My favourite thing about these speeches is the background music along with it. It’s the vibe the music gives me that really pushes me to do the things I need to do in the morning.

Most of these motivational speeches are targeted at entrepreneurs but I believe the advice is solid for many others as well. It’s a great way to just get that extra motivated feeling every single day, no matter where you are in life.

Here's one of the playlists: https://open.spotify.com/user/nickfearless/playlist/78Suoigk80gI9mI9z5tYl8

# 13.  Watch commencement speeches by successful people - takes 10 minutes

It’s important to realize something: successful people are usually the people that went through tough times in life - whether they were young or old - and have **found a way to cope with it and push themselves to do more** through the benefits from the fact they got through that experience.

Which is why watching commencement speeches is such a great way of **learning how they did it.** It’s someone who - in other people’s eyes, and sometimes not even their own - have reached a point in life that is very inspiring. And, being at that point, they tell a crowd of graduated students on how to go on in life now that they’ve finished what most consider is the hardest thing they have done until that point in life.

I can highly suggest watching these speeches at 1.5x speed on YouTube. You can still hear what they are saying and it’s a great way to speed things up. Speeches by [Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA), [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TEc_qyKQ0c) and dozens of other people **that are at the top of their field** gave speeches like this and these are extremely inspiring. Take some notes on the things they say, I still read many of the notes I took when listening to these speeches.

# 14.  Create something of value for the world - takes 10 minutes

If we’d all do this, the world would be such a better place.

But, sure, most people won’t do this because they don’t believe they have the time for it or just feel like they have other priorities - and that’s totally fine. **Just know that when you do something of value for the world, you create something of bigger value for yourself.**

See, what most people don’t realize is that you will be a lot happier and satisfied in life if the things you do are making other people better. Hence me writing this article; even if it only helps one person, I am fully satisfied with the results.

The world is too big to be selfish and it’s so easy nowadays to create something of value that many people will see. Just working on things that matter to yourself is a good way to start in life but at one point you gotta realize that **the things that make you a great person are things that can be extremely inspiring to others**.

Take 10 minutes every day and just work on something that creates value. Write something for your Facebook, think of a motivational quote and make an image of it, make some art. It doesn’t have to be finished on that same day, even if it takes 6 days (which gives you an hour) you will at least create something of value.

Those who create value for others will get value in return. Maybe not right away but definitely in the future.

Again, our world is too good for everyone to be selfish. For everyone to just make decisions that only benefit themselves. Find ways of creating value and you will not just help yourself but will also inspire others to do the same.

# 15.  Drink coffee/tea and just sit still for 10 minutes to relax - takes 10 minutes

You will most likely recognize this: you get up, grab some coffee and drink it while doing something else in the meantime. Check your phone, looking at emails, replying to your latest texts.

While doing that, **you are not giving your brain even a second to just relax**. You’re filling your head with external information that isn’t necessarily important at that moment. What is important is that you often take time for your brain to relax.

Imagine if you were an athlete. And every time you finished a 30-minute run and are resting to take another 30-minute run you just keep running. *Have you ever seen a runner do that*? Have you ever seen someone lifting weights and in between sets *they didn’t take a rest but rather just got different weights and kept lifting*?

Your brain is your most important aspect of yourself. **You’re nothing without your brain**. Luckily, we all have a brain. Yet we never give it the rest it needs. Rather we just constantly fill it with information.

So, next time you grab that cup of coffee or tea, just sit down and relax for 10 minutes. Just think about life. Think about what else you’re going to do today. Just let the thoughts run through your head - it’s not going to kill you. Give your brain some time, take care of it, because you’re going to need it for the rest of your life.

# 16.  Take your vitamins and/or supplements - takes 1 minute

Now, this one isn’t for everyone but I do believe it’s important to take some supplements in the morning.

For example, I live in a country where the sun doesn’t come out much - if we’re lucky we have about 3 weeks of great weather during the summer (although we’re expanding on that thanks to global warming).

This means I have a high lack of Vitamin D in my life, there’s just not enough sunlight during long periods and my body will not produce any Vitamin D because of it. So, every morning, I take some vitamin D to make sure I get enough of it in my body. A lack of Vitamin D is linked to feeling bad, more depressed and just not functioning well.

Along with the Vitamin D, I also take some Omega 3, 6 and 9 supplements. Just 2 pills a day gives my brain those extra fats that I need for it to function at its best. Rather than having to eat a bunch of fish every day, taking those two supplements is a great alternative.

Again, **this takes about 1 minute a day** and is one of the best ways to make yourself feel better. It’s the third thing I do in the morning and I always highly notice the difference in a day when I take my vitamins.

# 17.  Take 6 deep breaths - takes 1 minute

Alright, so here’s my favourite one and I only recently heard of this while listening to [the episode of the Tim Ferris Show with Aubrey Marcus](https://tim.blog/2018/03/12/aubrey-marcus/)

We all know the saying “Just take a deep breath”. Yet, as you may have noticed, usually **that single breath isn’t really helping you to feel any better.**

Rather than just taking one, it’s better to take six. Because when you take six breaths, you will actually feel the difference. Just count them while you are breathing in and out *-breathe in- 1 -breathe out- 1 -breathe in- 2 -breathe out- 2, all the way up to 6.*

Now, this works with pretty much any emotion. It’s just not going to take that anger, anxiety or whatever it is away. But it will take the edges off. And once the edges are gone, you can allow yourself to do the things that build upon the deep breaths that result in feeling calmer.

# Yes, you definitely do have 10 minutes to spare every single day

Well, you made it all the way to the end of the article.

  
And as I promised, I will tell you why you do have 10 minutes to spare in order to at least pick up one of these habits in your life.

See, what most people don’t realize is that **they are not doing this because they feel busy**.

Here’s a little secret: **people that think they’re busy all the time aren’t actually busy, they just tell themselves they are busy**. Their brains are filled with things they believe they need to do and are constantly in overdrive which leads them to feel like they can’t just take 10 minutes to do something like meditation.

**If you feel like you don’t have time to do any of these, you should definitely do one of these**! Because they will make you feel so much calmer in your head that you won’t feel like your brain is on overdrive all the time.

So, here are several things that you can skip in order to spend 10 minutes on any of these, so you can no longer tell yourself that you don’t have time for it:

-   You don’t have to watch that next Netflix/tv show episode
-   That YouTube video is still going to be there tomorrow
-   You don’t need to check Facebook 25 times a day
-   You don’t always need to check the latest news
-   That email can actually wait for a few hours
-   You don’t have to go to every social event
-   You don’t have to stay in bed 10 minutes longer
-   That 30-minute shower isn’t always helping you
-   You don’t need to check the latest funny images online
-   Your investments aren’t going to be going insanely up or down in the next 20 minutes
-   You don’t have to be around colleagues during the entire lunch break

mssdw3,"I know what it sounds like when people say you just have to get up and do it. Trust me, I know the feeling of it all being just too much. I’ve been battling depression for a while now and I’ve seen how incapacitating it is first hand.
Now, first off: if you have any sort of mental illness that is pulling you apart, then the first step is to get that under control with a mental health professional. This was the first step I’ve taken before anything because I was suicidal and any strain could be the last straw.

Having that said, you can’t expect things to get done on their own. Studying isn’t gonna become a fun game anytime soon. Neither is exercise or work. Flow state is mostly bullshit for beginners because you only get that years and years into practice.
What I’ve learned in a year of getting back to studying is: do things with your body, not your mind. Your mind is lazy and very convincing in talking you out of being productive. Your body obeys you blindly. Sit your ass on that chair and open the books.

If you’re a procrastinator, get yourself one of those studying apps with timers. They have resting time during which you can procrastinate all you want. Just force yourself not to when the timer is running for study time.

Your victories will be small, your work will be great. Know that things take time and be patient. One hour of study a day is 365 a year. Remember that. Even if you gain little, it’s better than gaining nothing at all.

Stop letting things out of your control bully you. “What if I don’t get in/don’t get the job/don’t get the girl or guy/don’t have the strength to keep going”. You’re putting a lot of mental capacity into predicting the future. You do not have that power. If your fears happen, there was nothing you could have done to stop it from happening. If they never do, you’ve suffered over nothing. Just make sure that when you lay your head on your pillow at night, you rest peacefully knowing you were the best you could be.

Stop beating yourself up over it. Don’t worry about all the time you’ve “lost”. The past is just as abstract as the future. You live here and now. Do what you can in the place you live and stop fantasizing about the place you used to live. You shed nearly all your atoms yearly, it’s stupid to believe you are today the same you were yesterday.

hl6w3l,"Hi, here's a less known point of view on procrastination. I've been procrastinating since my adolescence and severely when I had mental issues. I spent hours on internet, consuming every video and article about procrastination. I even know every tip like Pomodoro, chunking ect. Yet, nothing worked, for years and I even had to drop out. Last year, I discovered Jordan Peterson and as a psychology student, I've never met a profile like him so I was curious. I also got into psychoanalysis, mostly Jung.

After many researches, I realized that procrastination tips don't help if you don't want to grow up. Jordan Peterson said it himself, his public is starry-eyed  when he talks about responsibilities. I also feel that there are 2 main problems that preoccupies this generation: ADHD and procrastination. It's even the theme of one of the most famous Ted talk !

Indeed, what differentiates this generation from the previous one is freedom, maybe...too much ? Unlike our parents we can chose to grow up...or not. Ie: We don't have to have to get a job and get married at 20. We can postpone it...and eventually avoid big decisions. That's because we got more tolerant, which is great, but more choices can lead to indecision then procrastination. Ie: I struggled to write my essays early. It was stressful, but I still managed to get decent grades, I wasn't homeless so there wasn't a real urgency to change.  I was only efficient at the end of written tests, where my time was really limited.

I also discovered the Puer Aeternus (Jung): someone who refuses to grow up. To grow up is to leave your comfort zone, infinite possibilities and constant pleasure, and it's fucking hard. Especially for creative/sensitive individuals, you literally have to kill a part of yourself. I though of this metaphor, where you're a sculptor and you have to cut parts of a stone block to obtain a beautiful sculpture. If you don't want to cut those pieces of rock, to let them go, you'll achieve nothing. That what struck with me, prioritizing hard work over pleasure, making big decisions, felt like a little death.

So what helped me is to basically ""kill"" the irresponsible, childish part of me by choosing work over pleasure. If life is suffering, you can chose self-inflicted suffering, which pays off later, or chose to avoid the suffering through instant gratification. But you don't even avoid the suffering, you just delay it, since it's inevitable, plus it only gets worse ! I also plan to live without my parents, so that I won't be able to rely on anyone else and will have to make decisions now.

TLDR: Last paragraph. Life is suffering. But if you deliberately face unpleasant tasks, you can make something beautiful and meaningful out of it.

That's my theory, feel free to share your opinions.

Edit: I wanted to share my opinions with people who could benefit from it, but I also wanted different opinions to improve my view on the subject, which I knew was incomplete, thanks !",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] Procrastination tips don't work if you don't want to grow up,1364,0.91
n4l661,"I’ll start by saying I’ve had 25 years of high level escapism, probably an average of 8hrs a day over that time period. I was an expert at procrastination and avoidance. This is what I have learnt from experience.

**1. We are all suffering** 

Our bodies and minds aren’t designed for modern life and because of that our pleasure/stress chemicals are all messed up.  

When we are stressed cortisol increases which makes us crave more pleasure seeking chemicals. Instead of getting into oxytocin, serotonin and endorphins I’ll just call it all dopamine for simplicity sake.

We all need higher levels of dopamine to get by, nearly everyone has some form of addictive escapism. Whether it’s hard drugs, alcohol, caffeine, sugar, junkfood, gambling, porn, social media, video games, youtube, buying stuff, it’s all similar, the only difference is the level of addictiveness and how bad it is for you.

The worse or further away our optimal life is the more dopamine we need to make up the difference. Everyone has a different optimal life based on personality but essentially we all want mostly the same things.

**2. Willpower/Motivation** **and the Detox/Binge cycle**

You get motivated for whatever reason, you read a post, watched a video or read “can’t hurt me”. Motivation starts the willpower cycle or how long you can run on low dopamine.

Lets say you need 100 hits of dopamine a day as your baseline, you get motivated and decide to do nofap when you usually watch porn for 30min a day. Now you are running at 80 dopamine hits a day when you need 100. Your max willpower might be -200 deficit so in 10 days your willpower will hit it’s max and you’ll go back to your addiction. Now that your willpower has peaked it has to get back to neutral/0 so you binge on porn for the next few days, you feel bad and you binge a bit more on your other dopamine sources. Eventually you normalise back to your usual habits before the next wave of motivation hits.

I have experienced this time and again. I get stressed out I hit the chocolate, I give up chocolate I need more video games, more porn, more entertainment. I give up video games I need more other stuff.

There is also the shit day low dopamine which can wipe out your willpower also. I’ll call this a 30% drop in your standard levels.

This occurs when you have a poor nights sleep or something bad happens during the day. You go to your usual dopamine sources eg youtube and there are no new interesting videos for you, you scroll reddit..meh. You go outside for a walk and the weather is terrible. It’s just a bad day, sometimes it is just natural variance but this can also push your willpower down too much that you cave in, hit the porn or go buy some junk food.  

**3. Cortisol reduction**

So we live shit lives and have higher cortisol than we should. We need to do the basics well to start. Things like a good sleep cycle, healthy diet, exercise, community are things we know that are good for us.

Back to the 100 hits of dopamine example, if we do all the good things maybe we get it down to only needing 80 maybe less but it is hard to notice the difference.

When a stressful event comes the cortisol really spikes so it causes us to either find more dopamine (increasing porn/video games/junkfood etc) or procrastinating/avoidance.  

This makes it really tough, those of us who procrastinate will slowly have a higher and higher build up of cortisol as all these things build up in our subconscious. Our 100 dopamine level is rising to 120, bring on more stimulus.

**4. Dopamine reduction**

We want to fix our lives, give up xyz but we lose dopamine, our willpower breaks and eventually end up replacing the unhealthy source with an equally bad activity or go back to it how do we manage?

First step is we have to start reducing the super stimulus. These are the highly pleasurable activities, eg porn, online video games, instant entertainment, energy drinks, junk food etc.

This isn’t easy but it’s a slow and gradual process. If you are addicted to say porn then when you give it up you have to do more of something less stimulating say scrolling reddit, because you still need the dopamine.

But now you have a reddit addiction! so we cut back entertainment subs and stick with more educational content. A reddit addiction is better than a porn addiction.

It is a fine balancing act but we want to gradually reduce our need for dopamine, this takes time, you don’t just cut a few things out and 6 months later you are like a primitive dude in a tribe just chilling.

This is the reduction side, we want our dopamine levels to drop to a more natural state so we can do more boring activities and push ourselves more instead of spending 12hrs a day hyped up on some form of stimulus.

**5. The law of diminishing returns**

We get the dopamine hit from a source, we then go back to the source for more and more dopamine, the  problem is we get less each time.

This leads to addictive behaviour, our primitive brain wants us to go out and find new things.

If you feel this addictive urge and low dopamine pay off you need to find a new source of dopamine. The last thing you want to do is just do the same thing over an over again.

**6. Adding New Habits**

It’s important to manage our dopamine, any new habit is going to suck away dopamine because our baseline needs are still so high.

A personal example is how I used to exercise. I’d be so hooked on stimulus that to do weight training I’d have to do a set of say dumbbell curls and then continue watching a youtube video during rest time. People do the same with music, it’s not to get you pumped up it’s because of boredom.

*Short-term payoff activities with low stimulus*

We want to be replacing addictive activities with these easy low stimulus activities that will give us slight amounts of dopamine. You can’t replace internet porn with low stimulus activities but you can replace addictive habits like scrolling reddit/social media/tv with some of these. Eg 4hrs of reddit becomes 2.

Reading -  if you find the right books they can be engaging and low stimulus, that makes them kind of neutral. The problem comes when you aren’t reading something engaging, it becomes taxing and then you need a dopamine hit to make up the difference. I’d suggest having a kindle and reading through multiple books at once if you are having this problem. I’d have some books on 5% read and just give up on them. Once I hit that good book I can read it an hour+ a day. I’ll usually read the less interesting educational book and then switch over before I get bored. So its maybe 20min then 40min.

Cleaning/Decluttering – this can take as long as you want but there is a good pay off. Less clutter means lower cortisol and when you are done you feel proud.

Walking in nature – being in nature is going to give you small hits of dopamine particularly if the walk is engaging or there are animals around. An early walk in a wild environment will give you the best level of dopamine.

*Medium Level*

these are things that will likely raise your cortisol slightly because you need to do research or there is an element of risk/failure, the payoff is a lot less instant than cleaning your room

art/craft/renovation – anything that requires some low level skill or buying products

An example I’ll use here is adding new flooring, it’s stressful to have to do something new that you have to spend money on, make decisions and mistakes. The payoff however is far greater when it’s complete. You can look at it multiple times knowing you did that and that you do have value and skills.

The main thing here is the activity has to be done to completion and you have to have the ability to do it.  There is no point starting and not finishing or not being satisfied with the finished product because this will lead to an increase in cortisol and no payoff. You’ll just end up doing more of the bad stuff to make up for it.

*High Level*

These are things that don’t payoff for a long time maybe 6 months or longer, something like weight training, you do it properly you get good results you casually do it and you just get bored and quit.

You lift weights, it is boring, you finish you are tired, you feel good when you make progress, improve your health and physical appearance. Like I said this takes a long time (some people might feel good straight after but don’t expect to be one of the lucky ones, they will get bored when they plateau).

**7. Creating Habits why they are so good**

So the main problem with doing a new activity is the cortisol/stress brain power needed to get started.

If I want to start running everyday I have to think of when to do it, where and then I have to put on shoes, make sure I have the energy to do it and am hydrated. It’s adding additional cortisol and cos I need a constant supply of dopamine I need to account for that also (meaning if you are hooked on stimulus you’ll get bored quickly)

By making this a habit we remove the everyday startup cortisol cos everything is set, we have locked in the habit.

This means we reduce the cost of doing the activity and can reap the long-term benefits. How long it takes until it is locked in is somewhere between 30-90 instances, preferably doing it everyday as it’s easier to not think about it.

**8. Putting it all together**

back to this baseline dopamine need of 100

We give up our 30min of porn addiction, which pushes us down to 80, so we add in say 2hrs of reddit to get back to 100 (reddit isn’t anywhere near the same dopamine/stimulus so we need significantly more without it otherwise we just get stuck in the detox/binge cycle).

Next step is to start to turn the extra 2hrs of reddit into 1hr and add in a 30min walk and 30min of reading, our dopamine levels needed drops to 95. It is dropping due our lower stimulation levels over this period.

We keep on this slow and steady path reducing our need for highly stimulating activities and we drop our cortisol levels by not adding in new stresses and by fixing up things like sleep, keeping our environment clean etc.

When our levels go down low enough we can add in some slightly stressful activities that give us a long-term payoff, just have to make sure we can handle them.

The lower your dopamine requirement needs the easier it is to take on new stress and to do boring activities. The important thing is to balance your dopamine while you are cutting or adding new habits.

Once you start doing this always look for ways to improve your life, your addictions will show where you are falling short, the main one being good social interactions/community (hence why internet addiction is so common).

\---

Let’s begin.

I wrote in the previous post about setting the goals. It is important to know where you are going in life. It is healthy for your mind and your body. These goals are concentrated in these four areas: family & friends, job & career, mental and physical health, leisure time.

I want you to remember something: **you are not doomed.** When you have an issue and you acknowledge it, half of the problem is solved. Trust me! People are capable of doing unbelievable things. Do not trick yourself that you are not capable of evolving or that you are doomed. You are just lost. So, you are here now. Take advantage of the things I wrote below and start making things happen. And you will feel much better and at peace.

If you want to continue reading this I must say that you need to acquire a complex, high-tech and very expensive piece of equipment, whereas you cannot continue further in your development and getting rid of your problems. I am sorry to say this but without doing this you cannot continue making your life better. I am talking about the latest piece of technology, so new that it seems like it is from the future. Ok, you need to buy this technology. The name of this technology is called: a notebook and a pen.

He he.

Writing down your goals is very important because by putting the thoughts out of your head, they become much clearer. I did not believe this until I tried.

First and foremost your should start writing down your goals regarding these four directions.

You can answer some of these questions:

·  What kind of family do I want to have? What kind of friend do I want to have? Where am I going to move? What the common thing between me and my family/friends? What I can and what I cannot tolerate on other? What sacrifices I am able to make for my social circles? What kind of people I would like to hang with to learn something from them? What can I do to meet the people I want to meet? etc.

·  What are my strengths? What kind of job would I like? How can I use my skills at my job? What new skills should I learn? Do I need to change my job this year or next year? Am I a career person? Can I manage having a career and working more than a usual person? Do I need to advance at the current job or to change it? etc.

·  How am I going to spend my spare time? What things I love doing that job cannot offer me? How much time am I going to invest in my hobbies? How many hobbies do I have? How can I prioritize my hobbies? Whom can I share my hobbies with? What thing fuels me with energy? etc.

·  Do I have any addiction? How can I manage them? How can I regulate my health, physical or mental? Where can I get help from? How much is my bad health is going to affect my family and job? Do I need help or I can get out of a problem all by myself? etc.

These are general question. You can come up with more. Asking these kind of questions will help you get direction and to orient in the future. Asking these questions it is just a *draft* for your future road. Why?

I am trying to explain this through the picture below.

Most of us do not have a clear life goal. Most of us do not know which road to take. Those people who knew from a young age are very rare. For the rest of us, life gets a little bit complicated. Though, we need a direction.

The red line represents the main direction you should have in life. It represents the maximum potential you can achieve. The maximum self-actualization.

How do you know your ultimate goal?

Well, you should focus on your strengths and the things you are capable of doing.

For example, if you like writing, your main goal should be in this direction – somewhere in the future you may be an author, a screenplay writer, a copywriter etc.

If you like spending time with people, if you are extroverted, you should take into consideration that a *solitary* job, won’t satisfy you. For an extroverted person there are plenty of jobs like being an actor, salesman, advisor, PR strategist etc.

If you are a compassionate person you should work as a teacher, as a medic, but on the other hand, if you are a tough guy, being a manager, working in military will fit you.

And these examples can continue forever.

**Focus on your strengths!**

So, not many people know exactly what to do in their lives and that is ok – the thing is that you don’t have to give up. How do you discover? You discover by experimenting and setting timeframes.

I did not know that I can't upload images on /getdisciplined.

[https://imgur.com/a/h2qDiZq](https://imgur.com/a/h2qDiZq)

The black dot is you. You have a fuzzy direction in life where you want to go (red line), but that direction is **upwards**. The black lines with the numbers represent different periods in life. The star is the ultimate life goal and perfect life - he he.

When you reach line one, you should ask yourself: *can I see what I am going to do in the future until line 5?* If not, focus on the next step, getting to from line 1 to line 2. When you get to line 2, ask yourself: *do I know how to get to 5?* If I can’t see that much in the future until line 3, focus on getting from line 2 to line 3. And so on.

**Remember, you should always aim high. That’s the main direction. But beware of the small steps. Set a timeframe in future time where you know you are capable of predicting it. If you don’t know what you are going to do in the next year, set a time frame for the next 3 months only.**

What about the arrows?

Well, those arrows represent that while aiming high, you won’t ascend straight up. There will be **ups and downs**. It is just the way it is. But by always aiming high, you will get eventually to the top.

The perfectionists always want to go straight from A to B – they ruminate and overthink the decisions to make.

**The best decision is to aim high and accept that there will be ups and downs.**

This picture I made is suggesting you that if you do not know exactly what to do for the next 10 years, for example, you should shorten your time frame to 1 year, or 6 months, or 3 months – you know better. By doing this, you are taking small steps and you will feel more in control. It is the only way if you want to keep your mental and physical sanity.

Make a goal in the next 6 months, do your best to achieve it and then new doors will open for you. But laser-focus on those 6 months and do not worry for the next 3 years.

And now the practical part. **WRITE IT DOWN.** Write your goals down in 4 categories like I said in the previous post. Do not worry if they are not perfect. You will adjust along the way. A bad plan is better than no plan – it gives you direction and motivation. It gives you sanity and stability.

I got into the trap of thinking only about my goals and not writing them down. WRITE THEM DOWN. They will get much clearer as you move along the way.

Next, how do you make the best decision for the next 6 months?

The first step is to aim high, focus on your strengths and to write the goals on a piece of paper.

Next,

The following lines are based on the book *Paradox of choice*  by Barry Schwartz.

The summary of the book is very simple: we are living in an era with countless possibilities. Whether is the partner we want, the food we eat, the clothes we dress, the jobs we want, the things to buy, the vacation we go to etc. There are an infinity of possibilities and this thing paralyzes the man.

Why?

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS THE BEST CHOICE!

Ok. Let’s see.

There are choices: X, Y, Z. You do not know which one is the best. So, several things are happening.

If you choose Y, after you encounter some *disadvantages (and you will)* you will think that X or Z were better. You just assume! You have no idea. This thing will get you into frustration and regret.

You will always be thinking that the other two were better – this thing will make your mind go crazy and not to be at peace with what you’ve chosen.

*So, you’re telling me that whatever I choose I will be unsatisfied?*

*Yes…*

I mean, kind of.

I said this because a perfectionist will always look at the bad parts of a particular choice. Having this mindset will ruin you over the years. Solution is this: **if you do not assume 100% what you’ve chosen, you will be unsatisfied.**

That’s it.

Practical tip:

When you want to choose between X,Y and Z, again, make a list of good parts and bad parts for every choice.

There will always be advantages and disadvantages. You win on one side and you lose on the other.

Also, the more you think about the good parts and the bad parts the more good parts and bad parts will come up in your mind. You can think about the decision to infinity and back.

How to solve this?

Present the choices, write the good parts and bad parts for every choice and then give yourself a **deadline**. DO NOT FORGET about writing things down!

**Assume it and action!**

Don’t you think it is kind of interesting that in our highly digitalized society and industrialized world people are less happier, more anxious, more unpleased?

This is one of the reasons, IMO – having too many options and not knowing which one is the best. Sometimes, you gotta act. If you wait for the perfect time and thing, *you will miss life*.

In this text I laid out some of the tools and strategies about dealing with procrastination and decision making. I know how it’s like to be a perfectionist who procrastinates, I know how to be in an analysis paralysis, I know how it’s like to be anxious and unpleased all the time.

That’s why I’m giving you the things I discovered about dealing with this problem in the past years.

So, next!

*Premeditatio malorum* is an exercise from the stoic philosophy where you are imagining intentionally the worst case scenario in order not to be taken by surprise by a particular disastrous event. Doing so, even if the worst case scenario will happen, you will be at peace because you expected it to happen.

The difference between premeditatio malorum and the fear of failure is that you are running towards the worst case scenario and you are prepared to confront it rather than running away from pain and suffering.

So, you have choices X, Y and Z. You wrote for every choice advantages and disadvantages. You chose Y. Now, you are going to assume the worst for the choice Y.

Take a piece of paper. Again, WRITE, don’t THINK in your HEAD!

Get a piece of paper and make two columns. At the top of each column write the following questions:

·  What is the worst case scenario?

·  How can I get out of the worst case scenario?

By doing so, two things will happen. Even if there will be a worst case scenario, you will be prepared, you won’t be taken by surprise and you will **have** **the tools** to get **out** of the situation.

Write everything that comes up your mind. Every detail, every feeling, every action. Use your imagination and write everything down. You have to squeeze all the energy from your brain and pour onto that piece of paper. Again, WRITE IT DOWN! Write everything, don’t judge yourself, don’t censor yourself – the best is yet to come.

What do you mean, man?

I mean that when you are doing this exercise you will feel more at *peace* and *in control* of that certain situation. AND, the best thing is that the worst case scenario that you imagined WON’T HAPPEN! AND, by doing this exercise, you already know **how to get out of a less worse situation**. **You** ***yourself*** **created the strategies and tools to get out of that situation. This thing gives you control, sanity and stability in your life!**

Pretty cool, right?

If you don’t trust me, try it by yourself. Again and again – I cannot emphasize the power of writing down your thoughts rather than imagining, ruminating and overthinking.

Next.

Now you know that the worst case scenario won’t happen. But still, when you want to make the move, you will feel anxious and afraid. If you don’t have control over this fear, you won’t move and procrastinate. As a perfectionist, you will want to do all the things to be all right from the start, and, many times, you will not do anything because you *won’t feel good enough.*

What do you do then?

This is the answer:

*The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek. – Joseph Campbell*

*‘I’m tired of philosophy, gimme some practical tips.’*

Ok. Here you go.

Confront fear. Period.

*- Man, I am afraid and you are telling me to confront my fears?*

*- How are you supposed to solved your fears if not confronting them?*

*- I don’t know, doing drugs?*

You got the point.

You chose Y. You wrote the worst case scenario about choice Y and you wrote the solutions how to get out of the worst case scenario. Anyway, you will encounter obstacles and you will be afraid.

The solution to confronting the fears is this: *the paradoxical intention*.

What is this concept?

It is a practice created by dr. Viktor Frankl where a patient who has a fear or a phobia is accessing his will to accentuate the fear in an exaggerated way **so it disappears**. In other words, when you have a fear of something, you are using your emotional energy and your will power to **feel** that fear in an extraordinary way – by doing so, it will disappear. This is why it’s called paradoxical intention.

It is a paradox because instead of running away from fear or trying to deal with it in some other ways, you are actually confronting it in an unusual, exaggerated manner.

Let’s take an example.

Public speaking is one of the most fearful act for people all around the globe. This is for multiple reasons: exposing yourself in front of a group of people, trying to remember the speech perfectly, trying to make a good impression on stage, not sweating or doing other funny gestures, not stumbling on the stage etc. If you’ve never hold a speech in front of the people, all the crazy thoughts in the world swirl in your mind – because you want to do a thing right, right?

But the thing is: *what you resist persists*.

So, how do you act in this kind of situation?

Well, you do the opposite: you try to make your heart beat like it’s blowing out of your chest, you will try to sweat 100 liters of sweat on the stage, you will try to mumble as best as you can, you will try to look stupid and unusual on the stage.

Another example: if you are a composer, try to write 3 bad songs each week and see what happens! – as an experiment.

By doing these things, a magical thing will happen: all the stress and worries will disappear.

Of course, you need a lot of will power, but the good thing is that it is possible.

If you cannot do it all of a sudden, you have to go **BIT BY BIT**.

Do not get again into a ***all-or-nothing perfectionist type thinking*** because it will not work, you will only waste time and you will beat yourself to death for a tiny mistake. I have been there, I know how it’s like.

You need to confront the fears, but you first need to know how much pressure, pain and rejection you can tolerate. When you set how much pain you can tolerate, go and confront it by using the paradoxical intention. Again, write down your fears and how much fear can you face because by doing this you can track your progress!

A thing perfectionists hate to do is …

**EXPERIMENTS!**

Yes, you should do a lot of experiments.

They say that life is a *sum of experiments*.

The problem of the experiment is that you almost never know the outcome – you have a desired outcome, but you won’t know for certain if it’s gonna work.

A perfectionist’s worst nightmare…

But there is no other thing to do. (If you know, please tell me, I couldn’t figure it out.)

You should experiment with your small fears and your goals.

**Set yourself room for intentional failure!**

**Fail and purpose and see what’s happening how you are going to feel.**

**You will see that many scenarios you imagined never happened.**

ltrhvc,"I recently learnt a lot about how to control my habits from an amazing book called [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). It’s an incredible book that’s had a massive positive impact on my life. I’m sharing the main insights i got from the book below as i hope they can help you too!

I’ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/17&4&aQmk8JmsrxM&reddit_posts) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/landing/reddit_posts) **for the things you learn** otherwise you’ll just forget so much of what is important. Here’s the insights i used to start mastering my habits:

&#x200B;

* **Each time** you **successfully do a habit** you **will find it less effortful to do next time**
* So the **most important thing** is to **make it as easy as possible to START a new habit.** Then you will start benefiting from the **powerful compounding effect**: you do the habit, it becomes easier to do, you do the habit some more, it becomes even easier to do etc…

&#x200B;

**Making it easy to START habits:**

* Best way is to **make sure it only takes 2 minutes to begin with**. You can increase the time later, e.g. start off by reading 2 minutes a day, then when the habit is solidified increase it to 5 minutes etc...
* **Habit Stacking** \- this is when you attach a new habit to some pre-existing habits you already do. e.g. if you want to create the new habit of reading 2 minutes a day, and you already have the habit of eating breakfast every morning, then schedule your new reading habit to happen just after you finish breakfast. I’ve found stacking habits like this helps me massively
* If you can, **try and join a group of people** who are **already doing the habit.** e.g. if you want to exercise more then join a football club. We are tribal people and so linking in some way to others who do something makes us much more likely to do it ourselves

&#x200B;

**Best ways to STICK to habits** once you’ve started them:

* **Reward yourself after completing the habit**. This gives you a dopamine hit which means you will be more likely to do the habit again next time, this works even though you know what is happening!
* Use **commitment devices** if you can e.g. if you want to stop going on some websites then install a chrome plugin that literally blocks you going on them. Setting public goals that you tell lots of people about can also act as a good commitment device
* If you can, have an **accountability partner**
* If you can, **pick habits that align with your natural abilities** as they will be easier to maintain
* **Ritualise the start of a habit** to minimise the thinking required to start the habit and so therefore make it less effortful
* **Reduce friction for good habits**, e.g. leave your gym shorts out overnight if you want to go to the gym in the morning. e.g. put an app you want to use on the first screen of your phone not on later screens.

&#x200B;

**Best ways to STOP doing bad habits**

* **Reduce exposure** to the **CUE** of the bad habit, e.g. if you want to stop smoking and you’ve noticed you always smoke when drinking a coffee in your garden then stop drinking coffee in your garden (that’s the cue). Note that Time and Location are the 2 most common cues.
* It is **MUCH easier to avoid temptation than to resist it** so if you can just **avoid situations where you know you will be tempted**
* **Increase friction for bad habits** e.g. if you want to stop eating all the chocolate then make sure the chocolate is kept in a hard to reach place rather than somewhere that is easy to get to
* **Punish yourself after doing a habit you want to stop** e.g. everytime you smoke decide to throw away $5 afterwards so that the smoking was made more painful to you

Scrolling social media the moment you wake up breeds procrastination. On the other hand, getting out of bed and moving is conducive to productivity.

**That said, don't consume content for the first hour after waking**. This means no social media, no music, and even no reading.

*Reading is great, but at the end of the day, it is still content that does not need to be consumed first thing in the morning.*

1mwgsen,"I used to think I was just a “night owl.”
But the truth is… I was just wasting my whole day and only getting serious when the deadline panic hit at night.

Daytime me = tired, scrolling, telling myself “I’ll start in 5 mins.”
Nighttime me = somehow grinding for hours straight.

Then I came across Parkinson’s Law:

Work expands to fill the time you give it.

And yeah, that’s exactly why I only got stuff done at night—there was no time left to waste.

So I flipped it: instead of “what do I have to do today?” I ask, “how much time am I giving this thing?


What actually helped

Time blocks
I cut my day into 15–25 min chunks.
Trick my brain: “You don’t have to work all day, just 15 minutes.”
Way easier to start.

Tiny rewards
Finish a block → treat yourself.
Examples: “Do 25 mins of writing, then order a nice dinner.”
Or “30 mins of studying, then walk downstairs for fresh air.”
It’s dumb, but it works.


The results

Not gonna flex like “my productivity tripled” or whatever. But:
I actually start tasks instead of putting them off
I mess around way less
And because I finish earlier, I actually relax without guilt


My takeaway

This isn’t about “grind harder” or becoming a self discipline robot.
It’s about better rhythm: work when you work, chill when you chill.

Because mixing them half scrolling, half pretending to work feels awful.
Cutting time into blocks basically turned my scattered day into something smoother.

8xbpg7,"No kidding. 2 years ago, [**I tattooed 3 checkboxes on my left hand**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKmo0gJg8Rk/). I drew them on by hand and then my tattoo artist just tattooed right over the lines.This tattoo served a few purposes:

1. Even if the list is empty, it reminds me to do stuff. It reminds me that shit always needs to get done.
2. When something needs to get done TODAY, it's on my hand. That way I won't forget about it. I forget pretty much everything unless it appears in front of me, whether on my hand or on my phone - stuff always needs to come to me.
3. The boxes themselves serve as something I get to check, and the act of checking them [executes the whole dopamine release thing](https://blog.trello.com/the-psychology-of-checklists-why-setting-small-goals-motivates-us-to-accomplish-bigger-things).

**2 Years later, here's some feedback:**

1. This tattoo is probably the best effing decision I made, as far as getting shit done, being motivated, and not forgetting things goes. Nothing has helped me more than this tattoo. No app, no book, no psychology, no nothing. This tattoo has honestly pushed my overall productivity up by 100&#37; alone.
2. 3 Boxes isn't enough. I'm often drawing a couple more on.
3. People who realise what it is think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen, which is kind of weird. I expected more people to have my wife's opinion of it (she's not a huge fan, if it wasn't obvious).
4. Having stuff on my hand has it permanently ""appearing to me"", so I will never forget something I wrote on my hand. I notice it while I'm typing all the time. Right this second, the words ""Chris Ad"" are jumping off my hand at me, because I need to help my buddy Chris with a Facebook ad he wants to set up.
5. Sometimes I don't get to all of it, so the next day before I get in the shower, I write it all down on a piece of paper on the kitchen counter, wash my hand clean in the shower, and as soon as I get out, before I'm even dressed, I've written it  all back on my hand.

Before I got it, I remember thinking ""how far am I willing to go to be better at GTD, being disciplined, and being more productive? Am I willing to go THAT far??"". I got the tattoo, and productivity honestly skyrocketed.So, if you struggle to remember stuff, write it on your hand. If that works for you, understand that checking a box releases the same chemical into your brain that is released when you have sex.

mbtzr9,"You might be running every morning, or spending an hour each night on that meaningful project.

But there comes a point that even the most disciplined person will face a rough day and make a bad decision, breaking their streak.

It might be that Dunkin Donuts left in the office pantry. Or the new update of that hot game that all your friends play. Or a bad night of sleep, and a decision to not wake up for that 6am run.

Just like with new year's resolutions, this is often where peoples journeys end.

That ""miss"" turns into two, then three, then soon we're sucked back into old, unproductive ways.

# So, how do we bounce back from our first miss?

By immediately sitting down to ask yourself:

**a) Why did you make that bad decision**, the underlying reason. You may have eaten that donut, but perhaps you were extra tempted because of exhaustion from working too late at night and also forgetting to pack healthy food.

**b) What you will change to make the better decision if you are in that situation in the future** (spoiler alert - you WILL be)

**c) What is the immediate thing you can do to bounce back.** For example, you missed your morning run, there's still time to do one now, even if it's night. Or it's hitting the kitchen and preparing a veg bowl for your lunch tomorrow.

Whatever you do, don't delay. And once you've done your analysis don't dwell.

949o2t,"“*You will never change your life until you change something you do daily*” \~ Mike Murdock

Think about this. You are the product of what you repeatedly do. Each small action is telling of who you are.

**Consistent small action over time develops into a habit**. Habits can MAKE or BREAK you. This means you need to be aware of everything you do. If you put thought and intent into your actions, you can develop good habits that will put you on the path to success.

**I know this is true because I experienced both the good and bad sides of habits.**

I used to be weak and pathetic. I was unable to handle stress - with my mind and body working against me. I thought it would *magically* change one day. That I would wake up and everything would be better. After years of thinking like this, I learned the hard truth. It was not going to change unless I made it change. It took time and effort, but I learned how habits could make or break success. After trial and error, I have developed habits that work best for where I want to go in life.

My misfortune was the result of falling into bad habits. Without consciously being aware, my mind programmed itself to crave poor performance and ill health. My biggest problem was the tunnel vision that came with it. For the longest time, **I was not aware of the mental prison I subconsciously built by adopting bad habits.**

Below you will find 5 habits that made **great** change in my life. The results I have gotten in adopting these habits would seem **unachievable** to my former self.

These 5 habits are:

1. Consistent Sleep Schedule
2. Outline Daily Goals
3. Eliminate Escapism
4. Dedicate Time to Personal Growth
5. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others

Each habit is outlined with a 3 step approach.

1. **Problem:** This is how I **was** living my life. A description of the troubles and pains I experienced without any **structure** and **discipline** in my life.
2. **Motivation:** This is a general outline of *what* the habit is *and why* you should adopt it.
3. **Result:** This is a testimonial of how my life changed as a result of adopting the habit.

# 1. Consistent Sleep Schedule

**Problem:** In the past, I was an anxious, fidgety mess. I would bite my fingernails, bounce my knees up and down, and was unable to sit still in lectures. My mind was foggy and I never had energy to do anything. Mentally, I was incoherent and dull. Mornings were the most difficult part of the day for me - with falling asleep being the second. Some days I had so little sleep that I started to lose my mind. So much so, that I tried to develop an online persona of being INSANE(What the f\*ck!?). That’s right! This was a BIG problem! My lack of sleep was starting to negatively affect my subconscious mind.

**Motivation:** In order to perform your very best, you need to be well rested. There is no substitute for good rest. You want to aim for 6 hours and 30 minutes to 8 hours of rest every night. This is the general amount of recommended sleep for adults. You may require more, so it is best to experiment. I am no expert on the intricacies of sleep; however I know your mind rests in 90 minute cycles. You want to set your sleep schedule to align with a whole-number of sleep cycles. If you wake up in the middle of a cycle, you will feel very drowsy - **making it much more difficult to get out of bed**.

Most importantly, you need to be consistent with your bedtime. In time, your mind will adapt to this time. On the first day, you may find it difficult to fall asleep. But, a few weeks from now, you will naturally be tired at bedtime.

**Result:** My quality of life greatly increased. With enough rest, I had energy to handle so much more. My patience and tolerance grew substantially. Without any thought, I was able to keep still. I no longer dreaded remaining in the same position for 2 hour lectures or 6 to 8 hour work shifts.

Here’s an example of my previous thought process:

*I will sleep after one more game of Left 4 Dead. \[finishes game\] Maybe one more? Yeah, I can skip my morning routine to add in another game and still get 8 hours of sleep.*

**This type of sleep “schedule” was as consistent as picking a spot on the wall, closing your eyes, and landing a dart on that spot after being spun around before each attempt.**

On the contrary, by having a set bedtime, I felt accountable to be ready for bed 30 minutes before sleeping. As a result of a consistent schedule, I had more time to function each day, because sleeping was no longer a guessing game. This improved my time management and allowed for me to accomplish more in a single day.

I chose to go the extra mile. **I wake up at 4:30 AM everyday.** The mornings are for getting ahead. Waking up early has given me more time to focus on developing myself. Because, after I go to work or school, I am drained of my energy.  But, by being awake early in the morning, I am able to focus all my energy on building myself.

My mornings are for: going to the gym, writing posts like this, meal prepping, and reading.

This is the thought process that drives my sleeping habit:

*Do not devote all your energy to building someone else’s dream.* ***Devote your energy to building YOUR dream.***

# 2. Outline Daily Goals

**Problem:** When I tried to be productive with my time, I always felt a burden of “*how much is enough?*”. I was unsure as to how many things I should do in one day or how much time I should devote to each task. This often left me lying in bed unable to sleep because I felt dissatisfied with my efforts.

**Motivation:** You can only do so much in one day. Without a definite plan, you will likely go through the day either aimlessly or not optimally productive.

Remember: **Time is a precious resource. You only get 24 hours in a day. It is in your best interest to make the most of each moment.**

Statistically speaking, you are more likely to meet a goal if you **write it down**. If you want to achieve something **every day**, you need to **outline your day**.

**Result:** At first, I started with college-ruled loose leaf paper. I bulleted tasks such as: gym: leg day, physics homework, 3 meals and 2 snacks(for mass gaining), meet dad for lunch, and so on. After completing a task, I felt an immense amount of satisfaction checking it off the list. Not only did this help me organize my efforts, but it gave me a measurable feeling of accomplishment. With completing a day’s worth of tasks, I would retire to bed without the anxiety of underachieving. Having escaped this anxiety, I felt I had more time to enjoy my life. Where I was previously rushing my workout to get home and do homework, I was now stopping to enjoy a conversation with friends at the gym because **I knew I had the time**.

As I grew more sophisticated in my outlining, I bought a **Bullet Journal**. This is a useful tool for determining if a task is worth your time. I use this more for *advanced planning*. That is: being overwhelmed with tasks and having to determine what is really worth my time. It helps you prioritize tasks. You should totally Google it!

Pro Tip: **Outline your day the night before, so you can wake up with your goals for the day already in mind.**

# 3. Eliminate Escapism

**Problem:** I spent more energy in video games than I did anything else. I would spend entire days playing video games. If I was not gaming, I was watching YouTube videos. The fact of the matter: I was wasting my time. My grades were not too awful; however, these distractions were not helping them. I had little motivation to do anything more than play video games. I actually viewed it as a purpose in life. While I will touch more on this in the **motivation** section, my video game *friends* viewed me as the leader of the group.  As such, I felt an obligation to these friends. I saw it as a duty to be the best. This evolved into a *cult of personality*. My friends viewed me as an unstoppable, infallible force to be reckoned with. They wanted to be just like me, which inflated my ego.

The game I drained countless hours into was *Left 4 Dead 2* from 2009.

When asking myself why I was so addicted to this game, I found four answers.

1. **Simulation of Competition**: My friends and I would queue up and play against other teams. We played to win. Though the game is almost 10 years old, we took the game VERY seriously. So much so, that we would be very nasty toward new players.
2. **Simulation of Friends:** The guys I played with had similar interests to me - something I could not find in real life. We were in similar life situations. The most important detail is: we had mutual music interests. Pink Floyd, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix. **We were more interested in depressing music**(Pink Floyd).
3. **Simulation of Skills:** I was acclaimed to be one of the best players around. I had been playing this game since its release in 2009. I felt that I put so much time into the game, I should not squander my skills by quitting. On the contrary, I had few real world skills. This was one of few places I felt I offered value to someone
4. **Simulation of Adventure:** For many, it feels like *everything has already been done*. The world has been explored and there is not much for one to discover. A man was already to the moon. Just about any useful form of technology has already been invented(and you would need millions, if not billions, to compete in that market). And, there is no more originality in creativity
5. . Without much more thought, I decided to give up on real-world motivations. I had this interesting video game world that offered me new, exciting experiences for hours on end!

**Motivation:** **Video games KILL your motivation**! But, it is not video games alone that do this.

Social media, TV & movies, and drugs & alcohol can all have have the same effects if they are indulged in too often.

These are forms of escapism. They offer the user a substitute for experiences they are lacking in real life.

Here is how each form of escapism acts as a substitute:

1. **Video Games**: Video games offer the player adventure and excitement. The most popular of video games such as Fortnite are enjoyed by groups of friends who compete with other groups of friends. This simulates group-oriented conflict. I believe conflict to be especially important in the bonding of men. They suffer together. They grow together. I believe this is why video games are mostly played by men.
2. **Social Media**: Social media offers the user access to all the people they know at a click of a button. This works well for people who want to connect but are uncomfortable to meet in person. They can hide behind the image of their Facebook profile and have discrete conversations with friends. **This makes it especially easy for those who are insecure to hide behind ambiguous text and lack of emotional expression in voice and body language which you would get with an in-person conversation.**
3. **TV & Movies**: TV & Movies are driven through story. While these stories are often fiction, they are written to be emotionally relatable. They give the viewer an emotional experience. These are often emotions that the viewer is lacking in their own lives. For instance, in watching *The Wolf of Wall Street*, the viewer cannot help but feel the excitement in Jordan Belfort’s claim to wealth and power. This type of lifestyle is especially coveted by young men between the ages of 20 to 35 - **the movie’s target audience**. Surely, if the viewer were as wealthy and as powerful as Jordan, they would be spending their money on huge parties instead of watching that movie.
4. **Drugs & Alcohol**: Substance abuse usually stems from the inability to cope with certain emotions. For instance, alcohol, colloquially known as “liquid courage”, suppresses anxiety, giving the user *courage*(ignorance of anxiety) they previously did not have. While the user does not forget about their troubles, they no longer feel the negative emotions associated with them.

**Result:** It was difficult to believe video games were ruining my life. **I experienced feelings similar to that of one with stockholm syndrome**. I wanted to leave, but at the same time I enjoyed comfort in my virtual captor. Breaking free was **painful, but worth it.**

When I became aware of **why I was addicted**, I found my problem easier to fix. I attacked each contributing factor individually.

1. **Competition**: I learned to compete with myself(*such as developing these 5 habits*). This gave me the drive to win over myself. These were real-world victories that made real-world change in my life. There was no longer a virtual abstraction that made my efforts realistically pointless.
2. **Friends:** As I developed who I was and what I wanted in life, I naturally began to attract similar minded people with my words and actions. This has turned into a mastermind group of people guiding each other to greater success. It is important to note that there is NO leader. Before, my ego was in love with the idea of being the leader. Video games were so narrow in the skills required to compete, one could master them and be the elite. **But, in the real world, there is so much to know and understand, you would be stupid to think you can master it all by yourself.** You need high quality friends that not only offer experience and fun, but that also offer you an opportunity to grow.
3. **Skills**: Having established a group of friends whom I grow with, I began to specialize in skills that offered them greater value. I have friends who are knowledgeable on fitness, business, and finance. In turn, I found a liking for media and entertainment. I spent about a year consuming as much information as possible on how media is designed and how I can make my own. With this knowledge, I gave my friends insight on how they can market their businesses and themselves.
4. **Adventure**: I learned to enjoy the journey of life. I began to enjoy simple trips to the grocery store. A walk through a park. Or, a conversation with friends. Each day became a new adventure full of new people to meet and new things to learn.

# 4. Dedicate Time to Personal Growth

**Problem:** Once I eliminated escapist habits, I needed something to fill my time with. Video games were taking 6 to 8 hours of my time each day. This time needed to be repurposed. I wanted to be a better version of myself but I was not sure as to how. **Where do I start?**

**Motivation:** Your thoughts are where change begins. You must consistently feed your thoughts new perspectives in order to grow. New perspective is a seed that can be planted in your mind. It germinates in your thoughts and experiences, and blossoms into a greater understanding of yourself.

There are multiple sources of new perspective. Here are what I have found to be **most** useful:

1. Books / audiobooks
2. TED Talks
3. Podcasts
4. Conversations (especially with new people)

**Result:** I believe dedicating time to personal growth was the best thing I could do. I viewed each new idea as a tool to be added to a mental toolkit.

For instance, after learning about habits and how they work in the mind, I have become more aware of how I can maintain good habits.

Here is what I learned:

*By giving into a bad habit, your mind releases dopamine which reinforces that action - further ingraining that behavior into the subconscious mind. This makes it more difficult to break the habit. But, by replacing a bad habit with a good one, your brain develops neurological systems that mute it and promote the good habit. While the good habit can grow to be stronger than the bad, it must be maintained through* ***consistent action***\*, or else the mind will retrogress back to the bad.\*

**Knowledge such as this has made me more effective in maintaining the 5 habits spoken about in this post.**

# 5. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others

**Problem:** This was my biggest problem in high school. Majority of my peers were on a school team. They were strong, fit, and healthy. I was the tall, skinny guy with acne. I felt my scrawny frame paled in comparison to the testosterone pumping physiques of the football players. This is where I began to hate my physical appearance. My voice was too high pitched. My legs were too skinny. And, . . .my hair was just . . . wtf I had no idea how to style it.

Needless to say, I had no self-confidence or self-esteem. The most I had going for me was academics, but even there I felt I was inferior.

I was the designated Math and Science nerd. I always carried my Calculus and Physics books with me and I enjoyed tutoring others during study halls. I genuinely helped others get As. It was an amazing feeling to help others achieve their own successes!

But, the sensation would not last for long because I felt I was failing in my own studies. This was due to competition with another classmate.

In my Calculus class, there was a guy who did not try at all and performed MUCH better than me. While I was at home studying hard for a test, he was goofing off, getting high with his cousin. He put barely any effort in and did better than me. **This boiled my blood.** But, I did not let it get the best of me. Instead, I started to study with him. Although he was goofing off, he still put an amount of effort in - though minimal as it was. I saw this as an opportunity to learn something new.

But, in the end, I got a B and he got an A. I was devastated. Of what esteem I had, it was destroyed. I would tell myself: “It’s not fair!”.

**But, out of this misery, I learned a valuable lesson.** I will tell you about it in the *result* section.

**Motivation: You cannot compare yourself to others!** Everyone has different experiences, culture, perceptions, perspectives, and so on! It is apples and oranges!

“Don’t compare your Chapter 1 to someone else’s Chapter 20”. You and I, we are in different places in life. There is no universal solution to everyone’s problems. You must look inward to find your solutions. Use this as an opportunity to challenge yourself! Evaluate your current situation and challenge yourself to be better.

It is important to note that there is a difference in learning from others and comparing yourself to them. When dealing with my academic problem, I decided to see what I could learn from the guy in my Calculus class. This proved to be fruitful in the long run.

When you are stuck, maybe you are missing part of the puzzle - something your mind is not aware of. Inspiration helps to solve this problem. Look at those who have succeeded in your area of struggle. Take the time to understand their thought processes and habits.

**I guarantee you: your biggest struggle is in your mind.**

**Result:** Before I knew it, my life was completely different.

Physically, I have become an avid gym goer. I do full body workouts 3 times a week. I have done the research and designed a meal plan that suits my *hard-gainer* body type. In the past ten months, **I gained 20 lbs of muscle.**

Academically, I have maintained a 4.0 in college. This is something I swore I would maintain without fail. I am in competition with my high school academics. Where I got a 3.98, **0.02 shy of a 4.0**, I will get a perfect GPA in a more difficult curriculum.

Reflecting back on studying with the guy in my Calculus class, I learned to *work smart not hard*. He was able to condense my 8 hours of studying into about 30 minutes of effort **by being smart**. His biggest crutch was his connections. He was friends with people who took the class the year before. They gave him old tests, which he used to study. The tests had the same exact questions just different numbers! He had such an advantage!

This inspired me to be more social - which rings true to the idea of: “**It’s not what you know, it’s who you know**”. In college, I found friends who specialized each in particular subjects. For instance, if I needed help with a math problem, I would ask my friend who is a math major. I created a mastermind group for college subjects. This worked best because I understood I cannot be a jack of all trades - something I aspired to be when I compared myself to others.

# Conclusion

Much of your misfortune may be linked to a subconscious habit. You could be driving yourself to failure without even knowing!

Your mind develops habits as a result of energy efficiency. A new experience overwhelms your mind with new sensory stimulations. But, as this experience becomes common place, your mind develops shortcuts, requiring less energy to perform the same operations.

This is where discipline comes in. In order to develop a new habit, you must discipline yourself to perform it. It is mentally difficult in the beginning. But, as you do it more and more, your mind adapts. You will be able to perform the same action with a fraction of the effort!

**Discipline yourself today, so your mind will discipline you tomorrow**.

*Gandamede*",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] How I Escaped My Mental Prison: 5 Habits That Changed My Life,1361,0.98
bjfpjn,"At the beginning of April, I challenged myself to be out of bed by 5:02 every morning. I wanted to see what the fuss was about, have more time to myself in the mornings, and I love a good challenge.

It's now May 1st, so the challenge is over. Here are my three biggest takeaways:

1. **Setting rules for myself really helped.** One of my rules was that I wasn't allowed to scroll on my phone in the morning. I'd always been a habitual phone scroller, which usually resulted in me wasting a good forty-five minutes or more in bed each morning. 

 I wanted to break that habit, and setting a rule that I wasn't allowed to scroll until I was out of bed helped immensely. I'm going to keep this rule in my life moving forward so that I don't get sucked three miles down the front page of Reddit before I've even turned a light on. 

2. **Getting out of bed, like everything else, gets easier with practice.** Who knew, right? The first few days of getting up at 5 were pretty rough. I had worked up to it and was getting up around 5:15 near the end of March, but damn, 5 is early and all I wanted to do was get on my phone.

  The longer this went on, the easier it got to just get up. I wasn't as tired, I wasn't as mad about it, and I knew that once I was up for a minute or two, I'd be totally fine. If you want to get out of bed right away, suck it up and make it happen for a week or so and it gets much easier from there.

3. **It's okay to fail.** I didn't make it the whole thirty days. By day 27, I was feeling pretty tired because it's difficult to go to bed by 9, and I was running a little low on sleep. It was getting difficult to focus and get work done throughout the day because I was so tired. Finally, I admitted defeat, and I didn't set an alarm at all the last three days of the month.

 And you know what? *I learned just as much from a ""failed"" attempt at this challenge as I would have from doing it ""perfectly.""* In fact, I probably learned more because this reinforced the lesson that good enough is good enough. Getting up at 5 those last three days wouldn't have taught me anything new that I didn't learn from the first 27 days. 

All in all, I'm glad I did it. I have a better understanding of myself and what does and doesn't work for me. If I were to do it again, I'd give myself Sundays off because sometimes a girl just needs a break.
