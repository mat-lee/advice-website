"I hate that I was 33 when I learned about setting S.M.A.R.T goals from one of my Master Chiefs. This model is stupid simple, yet highly effective. Just follow along, you'll get it: Specific Your goal must be clear and precise What exactly do you want to achieve? No vague objectives EX: Instead of saying 'I want to get in shape,' I would start with 'I want to do 10 pull-ups.' It's a specific number, instead of something arbitrary, meaning you now have a set number you can reach Measurable This is your time-table. How will you track it? There MUST be a realistic way to track it on paper, or on an Excel spreadsheet, or a Word document. Something material This is the equivalent of quarterly reviews in business EX: Currently I can do 0 pull-ups, and I want to do 10 pull-ups. That means by March (The date is currently 23FEB2025), I'd like to work my way up to 1 pull-up, and if I continue exercising and monitoring my diet, I should be able to do 3 pull-ups by May. This is part of tracking Achievable Is this doable? If you've never done a single pull-up in your life, and you weigh 210 pounds with very little muscle, it is absolutely unreasonable to say 'I want to do 10 pull-ups by next month' because you need to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to develop the necessary muscles to achieve that goal Start small. Don't take on a marathon if you can barely run a mile Realistic/Relevant Make sure the goal aligns with your life, your values, or your objectives. I'm in the Military, so it makes sense I would set personal fitness goals Make sure it's worth your time and effort. There is no reason for me to want to learn how to speak Vietnamese, it's irrelevant to my life Make sure it's a realistic goal. I had terrible grades in High School, I'm unfocused, and I'm a college drop-out. There is no world where I will look at my peers and say 'I want to study Law at Harvard' without getting laughed out of the room Timeliness Set a deadline. I want to do 10 pull-ups. Okay, when?

"Change Your Life 1 Small Step at a Time Change rarely comes from giant leaps. Instead, it comes through small decisions made day-after-day. I used to have an all-or-nothing mentality. And that resulted in me getting stuck in a vicious cycle: First, I would work extremely hard towards changing my life for a few days or weeks. Then, I would burn out and not do anything for a long period. After doing nothing for a while, I would feel the need to make a change again. And would repeat the cycle. I finally got out of that cycle when I started focusing on making small changes. Changes that were small enough that I could keep up with them in the long-term. Here’s how to do that: Prioritize your goals: You can’t do it all at once. Often it helps to just focus on 1 new change at a time. When starting a new habit, go as tiny as possible: For example, if you want to start meditating, don’t try to do 30 minutes a day. Instead, start with something smaller. Like 1 minute. Wait until you’ve formed a strong habit before you start making things more challenging. Have specific, tangible goals: You are much more likely to follow through with a small, specific goal, than a broad, vague plan. For example, you are not that likely to commit to something general, like I want to learn programming. But you are much more likely to commit to something specific, like I am going to watch this introduction to JavaScript tutorial tomorrow morning. If you start small, it will ADD UP to great things.",Build Positive Habits,Habits,lw0bsm,4030,0.98,r/getdisciplined,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"Get Organized! If you want to change, one of the first places to start is organizing your life. Organization makes it easier for you to follow through with your goals. Because the more structured your life is, the more control you have over it. Here are some ways to get more organized: Keep a to-do list: When you write down your plans, you are much more likely to follow through with them. Have a regular schedule: Wake up and go to bed at similar times each day. And consider having regular morning and night routines you follow. Clean your place: It doesn’t have to be completely pristine, but it helps to establish good cleaning habits.

Start a streak I started a streak for reading. Nothing elaborate. Just 5 minutes of reading daily. First got to 35 days and accidentally broke it off on a weekend.

Also I'm not in a rush to finish 100 books like many productivity blogs and their uncles advocate. I don't believe in quantity. The most impactful books took me at least a month to read and that was because I intentionally paused to try some lessons in the book before coming back to it.

"If your home living situation was not abusive and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). You can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own. If things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. Some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer. If you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. Maybe they are not great people. Maybe you don't believe in the same things. As long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent.

Even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. The specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well). Contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. You shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you or in your room if you contact the police.",Housing Options,Home,bgv0wy,16649,0.94,r/personalfinance,0.9,1.0,0.9,0.93

It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.' As far as procrastination is concerned, reading helps because it teaches me about concepts related to procrastination. For example, reading taught me about meditation and mindfulness.

In framing the question surrounding delayed gratification not as, 'what do I have to give up?' but as, 'what can I still get?' you can creatively come up with ways to make the process of delaying gratification a whole lot more fun.",Balance Gratification,Mental Health,nvd4u0,667,0.99,r/productivity,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.83

"By building a relationship with your future self and by seeing your future self as your current self, just in a different context, it'll be easier for you to delay gratification and to do things to help out your future self because ultimately, you're helping you. If you have trouble imagining your future self, you can put a picture of yourself through an aging filter to what your future self may look like. You can interact with your short-term future self by delaying gratification in small ways that have a practically immediate benefit. For example, you can delay the immediate gratification of hopping into bed by setting up the coffee machine so that when you wake up the next morning, you can get your coffee without any hassle. In building a relationship with your future self, it's important that you consciously acknowledge when you're doing something for your future self and that you consciously acknowledge when you've reaped some benefit from the efforts of your past self. So, when you're setting up the coffee machine at night, think, 'I am doing this for my future self,' and when you wake up the next morning to a fully prepped coffee machine, thank your past self.",Future Self,Mental Health,nvd4u0,667,0.99,r/productivity,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9

"Don't subtract calories from exercise (unless you do something that burns shittons of calories). First of all, the calories estimates for exercise in MFP are wayyyyy off. They are way too generous. I've seen it tell people that walking 2 miles burned 450 calories. People complain that they diet and exercise but don't lose weight... well if you are counting exercise towards your diet and use MFP for that, I'm not surprised! Second of all, I'm of the opinion that if you're trying to lose weight, why run 3 miles and then eat those extra 300 calories? You could be losing weight by keeping that deficit. As long as you're eating at least the minimum your body needs, you don't have to replenished those calories burned through exercise. However, I'd like to reiterate that if you do some exercise that burns tons of calories (like intense swimming), you should probably eat those back!

You of course can reward yourself with any activity or thing that will motivate you to stick with your goals.

"Learn that motivation comes after starting Most Olympic athletes don't sit on the couch at home and suddenly think: 'I want to be an Olympic athlete'. Instead, they've already done the exact type of sport they want to go to the Olympics for. Their motivation comes from the fact they've already been involved in that sport for years. It's the same for you, as it is for me. For months I've been going to the gym, but I also wanted to start swimming again alongside it. I didn't. Until this past Monday.

So I go higher. It's so I'll get a great, awesome job tomorrow. I still don't feel motivated. So I go higher. Getting a great job is so that I can have a great, successful FAMILY. SUDDENLY I feel awesomely motivated. FAMILY resonates more with my subconscious, and I never knew it.

This is why we can decide what to do, but we might not feel like doing it at all when the time comes. So, when I need to read, I tell myself.

If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen.

Gathering the right people around you is extremely important. They will keep you sharp. You can use them as a backup when you are not motivated. I have a hard time going to the gym by myself, no matter how much I want to work out. So I have gathered two people around me to work out with. Either I go with one or both, but I hardly ever go alone. The day before I text them: 'Gym tomorrow 8 AM?'. Sometimes both will go with me, sometimes only one will go with me.

"Improve Your Social Skills I used to be incredibly awkward in social situations. My awkwardness was particularly severe during high school and in college. But continued to an extent through my mid-20s. It wasn’t until I started consciously working on developing my social abilities, that my awkwardness started to diminish. Here are some keys to improving your social skills: Go outside of your comfort zone: In my mid-20s, I made a conscious effort to try to be more social than I had been and to meet new people. And as a result, I made some great connections. Open Up: I used to be more closed off. Unless I was around my close friends, I tended to shut down. For a long time, that held me back, because people are attracted to genuineness. Once I started opening up more, it helped me develop closer relationships. Listen: I used to be a horrible listener. Becoming a better listener has led to much deeper and better conversations, both personally and professionally.
