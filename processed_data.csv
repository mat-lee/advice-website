9t0gqz,Dopamine is the key player here.,41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,Most people think dopamine is responsible for 'pleasure'.,41,dopamine / activities

9t0gqz,Nowadays this is proved to be wrong and the actual function of the dopamine circuit is believed to be wanting and motivation.,41,dopamine / activities

9t0gqz,"Now, why should you care?",-1,life / just
9t0gqz,The reason is very simple.,103,simple / reason
9t0gqz,Exposure to high dopamine for longer periods of time REDUCES DOPAMINE RECEPTORS.,41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,"Lower dopamine receptors give you lower motivation, lower concentration and less mental sharpness.",41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,With there being a lot of supernaturally high dopamine giving activities and substances available to us we should all be aware in what amount we should consume them.,41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,This is the reason why there are more college and university dropouts more than ever before.,-1,life / just

9t0gqz,So what to take away from all this?,-1,life / just
9t0gqz,Lessen the amount of activities you do each day that give you a lot of dopamine and don't add anything to your life.,41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,This will give you a natural amount of dopamine receptors again and will make it a lot easier to stay concentrated while reading or learning an instrument for example.,41,dopamine / activities

9t0gqz,You could also experiment with it and change it up how you like it.,20,small / start
9t0gqz,The real magic (and the reason I made the coach analogy) is on the right page.,73,coach / people
9t0gqz,Here is where I write down every influential activity I do.,-1,life / just
9t0gqz,I won't write down things like 'have breakfast' or 'short chat with roommate'.,-1,life / just
9t0gqz,I write down everything that has a positive or a negative meaning (some things are neutral like doing groceries).,-1,life / just

9t0gqz,You will get a lot of feedback on what you do each day.,-1,life / just
9t0gqz,When I first started doing this I was shocked by how much red activities I had and  made it a mission to get more green activities in there.,-1,life / just

Things like watching TV (or netflix), internet, drugs, processed foods, porn, gambling and videogames. Things that give us a lot of dopamine tend to be addicting. No wonder I was only smoking, watching screens and lying in bed when I hit rock bottom.",41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,"Now, why should you care? The reason is very simple. Exposure to high dopamine for longer periods of time REDUCES DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. Lower dopamine receptors give you lower motivation, lower concentration and less mental sharpness. With there being a lot of supernaturally high dopamine giving activities and substances available to us we should all be aware in what amount we should consume them. This is the reason why there are more college and university dropouts more than ever before. Why so many people are unhappy at work. And why there are more cases of depression than ever before (depression is linked to lower dopamine).",41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,"Big companies know about this and use it to sell us as much as possible and keep them on their platforms for longer. They put the exact amount of sugar in all foods so that we like it the most, they design their platforms so you stay on them a lot (Facebook and Instagram), they implement gambling into games so that we play them more (Fortnite).",-1,life / just
9t0gqz,So what to take away from all this? Lessen the amount of activities you do each day that give you a lot of dopamine and don't add anything to your life. This will give you a natural amount of dopamine receptors again and will make it a lot easier to stay concentrated while reading or learning an instrument for example.,41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,# FLOW ACTIVITIES,47,business / final
9t0gqz,"1 book that has made a profound impact on my life is the book Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience. The idea of the book is that there are certain activities that for which your brain needs 100% of  it's power to be focused on the activity. This is when you reach a 'Flow state'. In this state you lose the idea of the self, you lose track of time and are only focused on the task at hand. For example when you drive somewhere and you get there and don't remember how you got there.",187,book / life
9t0gqz,"Flow occurs when your skill matches the challenge of the activity. When your skill is too high, you will be bored, when the challenge is too high you will be anxious.",42,flow / activity
9t0gqz,"The key idea from this book, for me, was the difference between pleasure and enjoyment. Pleasure activities are ones that give the high amount of dopamine. Whereas enjoyable activities also give dopamine, but also make you better at the task and will often produce a state of Flow. Enjoyment produces growth, pleasure does not.",41,dopamine / activities
9t0gqz,"I think that any activity in life that is not a pure pleasure activity can be made into a flow activity. It's one of my goals in life to fill my day with enjoyable activities. It made me realize I wanted to fill my day with making music and reading, not with smoking and watching TV.",42,flow / activity
9t0gqz,# JOURNALING,176,journaling / right
9t0gqz,One of the best habits I have build is journaling. More specifically bullet journaling. I'm not sure if this is the official way to do it but this is what I do and what works for me.,176,journaling / right
9t0gqz,"People pay coaches a lot of money to do something they can do themselves as well; give feedback. All a coach does is tell you what you've done, and where you can improve. This is something you can do yourself easily by bullet journaling.",73,coach / people
9t0gqz,"My method: I have a simple notebook where I use the left and right page for 1 day. In the morning I write down some things I want to do that day on the left page. If there are things I wanted to do yesterday I write them down for today. I also write a bit about how I feel. Recently I've been doing some affirmations as well on that page. You can skip this entire left page, I personally like it, but I can understand how it's a bit much for some people. You could also experiment with it and change it up how you like it.",-1,life / just
9t0gqz,The real magic (and the reason I made the coach analogy) is on the right page. Here is where I write down every influential activity I do. I won't write down things like 'have breakfast' or 'short chat with roommate'. I write down everything that has a positive or a negative meaning (some things are neutral like doing groceries). Then at the end of the day I will use a marker to color code every activity either green (positive) or red (negative). So for example:,-1,life / just

9t0gqz,(red) hangout with X toxic friend and drink beer,-1,life / just
9t0gqz,I hope you see what I meant with the coach analogy now. You will get a lot of feedback on what you do each day. When I first started doing this I was shocked by how much red activities I had and  made it a mission to get more green activities in there. It was slow progress but steadily it got better.,-1,life / just
9t0gqz,"If you don't like the left part of the journaling (which is how most people recommend it), I would advice you to try the right page. If you're gonna do one, it should be the right page. See it as a free life coach.",176,journaling / right
9t0gqz,# SLEEP SCHEDULE,210,sleep / wake
9t0gqz,When I was at rock bottom my schedule was the furthest away from perfect that it could possibly be. One of the first things I changed that lasted was my sleeping schedule. I was done waking when it's almost dark already and still being tired. Also I noticed that everything I did in the late evening wasn't productive (or even counterproductive) like watching screens and doing drugs,203,time / work
9t0gqz,"There are good reasons to wake up early (5-6-7 AM). The best sleep you can get is the sleep between 10 and 12. If you're still awake at 00:00 you will produce cortisol and adrenaline to keep you awake. This isn't healthy. Good sleep improves cognitive function, vitality and motivation by a lot. There are many more benefits to a good sleeping schedule, and I think it's well known that it's a lot better. However most people think it's hard to change their schedule.",210,sleep / wake

hfoes5,"* **Use laughably small tasks, if you must.** If necessary, start *stupidly* small. For example, let's say you always procrastinate cleaning the bathroom. Start today by telling yourself that you're going to walk into the bathroom - that's it, just walk in.",-1,life / just
hfoes5,"* **Practice making the smallest tasks rewarding.** Do your laughably small task. Next, reward yourself with a pat on the back, or play some music, etc. The goal isn't to clean the bathroom, remember. It's to associate cleaning the bathroom with good feelings. That starts by just associating the bathroom with reward, not with ""ugh, I have to clean all of this stuff."" Don't take on a big task that feels painful yet. You want to undo the association of ""work = pain."" Don't expand the task until the laughably small version of it feels rewarding.",215,cleaning / clean
hfoes5,"* **Give yourself a reward cue.** For example, if you set an Alexa timer for five minutes of bathroom cleaning, use that timer as the cue to give yourself a reward.

ul26za,"When I was in college, I had an assignment due for several weeks and being the procrastinator that I was, I obviously waited until the last day to get started. Due time was at midnight, so I woke up early that morning, brushed my teeth, took a shower, made coffee etc., all while priming myself to get this assignment done. I opened my laptop and then… things didn’t get done.",199,work / doing
ul26za,"I spent hours dreading the work, looking at everything and nothing all over the internet, all to avoid getting started. Just one more video turned into a whole 8 hours of doing nothing productive at all. The stress and guilty feelings got worse and worse every passing minute. It got to the point where I started feeling physically ill. I was so overwhelmed and stressed that I just closed my eyes and tried to calm myself down. This wasn’t about the assignment anymore, I just needed to relax, or I was going to implode.",199,work / doing
ul26za,"I stopped thinking about the assignment. I stopped worrying about worrying. I just focused on relaxing. One thing at the time. And then when I opened my eyes, it all suddenly made sense. The pain of not doing my assignment was outweighing the pain of doing it. So I decided to just open my assignment and stare at it. I stared at it until I got bored (like a solid 2 minutes of just starting at a blank page on my computer screen). And then I just started typing.",199,work / doing
ul26za,"The assignment was done in (I kid you not) 3 hours. 3 hours. I spent 8+ hours making myself ill worrying about doing work for 3 hours. And I recall it wasn’t even painful to do, it was relatively easy actually. Ever since that day, whenever I procrastinate, I try to think of this moment. The pain I was feeling, it was real.

7xzy1f,"All right, so let's start with some context. Way back in 2008 I was like many young men entering their 20s: An underachiever who finally realized he had to take some steps if he wanted to attain the life he wished. Like many young men, I developed an addiction to self-improvement. My first ""hit"" was reading ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss and chasing the idea of becoming the best version of myself. Although I never became the master PUA I wanted to be at the start, I managed to make several drastic changes to my life: I dropped from over 20% bodyfat to under 10% and built a fair amount of muscle, I changed my grades from mediocre (High School) to absolute top notch (University), I managed to stop smoking and cut out some other addictions, I developed a very rigid sleep schedule, and pretty much everything in my life went the way I wanted it to. More importantly: I was extremely disciplined. If I wanted to do something, I would outline a plan and follow it rigorously. In my mind, this was obvious, and I would tell others seeking advice to ""Just fucking do it"".",106,life / years
7xzy1f,"However, due to circumstances outside of my control, my progress in my study program was halted, and I spent an entire semester with no clear purpose or idea of where my future was going. I did not know so at the time, but during this semester, I somehow lost my trait of discipline. My habits stuck with me - I got through my master's with honors, and I kept on working out, but It slowly dawned on me that I had serious trouble with applying change to my life.",-1,life / just
7xzy1f,"So, for the next six years or so, I felt that something extremely important was missing from my life. I had this vision of the person I wanted to be, yet I wasn't moving in the right direction. I started feeling guilty about all the time I wasted, and I would periodically (maybe every three months) sit down and write down goals for a set period, week plans etc. I would read about some method online and set out a detailed plan to follow it. And every time, the same thing would happen: I would fail. Every single actual change I wanted, I would fail at. I wanted to get better at running (in contrast to lifting), so I set up a program for it. After a few weeks I realized I wasn't following the program at all. I would come up with an excuse or procrastinate. Every familiar area however, would be no problem at all. I could set up detailed plans and follow them. As this repeated again and I again I started believing that something was seriously wrong with me. Was I doomed to never return to my glory days of discipline?",-1,life / just
7xzy1f,"Then a realization hit me - for the first time in a long, long time. Of course I wasn't getting disciplined - because none of what I was doing actually had anything to do with discipline.",70,discipline / disciplined
7xzy1f,"I remembered a professor from my master's who told us about a study he had conducted on Norwegian top skiing athletes. The goal of the study was to see what separated the winning skiers from the mediocre ones. To everyone's surprise, the answer had been quite simple: The top skiers actually followed the training programs and diets they were told to follow.",206,marathon / running
7xzy1f,"I had everything backwards: Plans, programs, and schedules don't give you discipline - they require it.",70,discipline / disciplined
7xzy1f,"Plans and programs are excellent tools in order to achieve results if you can follow them. But in my case, I realized they were a part of an increasingly vicious circle. This circle went something like this:",191,follow / plan
7xzy1f,I feel bad about myself not living up to my potential and wasting time.,-1,life / just
7xzy1f,I decide to do something about it.,87,decide / floats
7xzy1f,"I come up with some method or plan, and typically make goals and schedules for the next week. I spend a lot of time visualizing where I want to be.",191,follow / plan
7xzy1f,"I become motivated and determined, and the anxiety/shame/whatever I feel is gone. I feel like I have accomplished something. I feel like I finally will realize it, this is it.",-1,life / just
7xzy1f,I fail to follow said plan,-1,life / just
7xzy1f,Feelings of shame and failure show up,-1,life / just
7xzy1f,"I distract myself with video games, socialization, or some other activity.",199,work / doing
7xzy1f,"I suddenly realized why this was happening, and what it actually meant that I lacked discipline. When I felt bad about wasting time - this was my brain's way of telling me that there are problems I need to attend to. Decisions I need to make. Instead of attending the problems however, I engaged in what could only be described as an advanced form of daydreaming. By designing a schedule and thinking about my goals, I created an illusion of myself as being productive that was so powerful that I would trigger the reward system in my brain. This made me feel like I accomplished something, although I actually had not.",171,motivation / planning
7xzy1f,"So why did I not follow up? Because I made plans that assumed that somehow, through sheer force of will, I would be someone else tomorrow, and would be able to motivate myself to commit to a long list of tasks. I somehow imagined that tomorrow I would have more willpower than today. But I never did. If I decided to wake up at 6 in the morning - that cost me a lot of willpower! This meant that whatever else I was planning that day was way less likely to occur. And not only that - I had wasted my motivational energy the day before on planning. My imagination had been so vivid that my brain decided to stop handing out motivational energy.",-1,life / just
7xzy1f,"Not only did my planning sap my motivation - it created a false sense of ""who I really was"" - what my potential was, that haunted me from day to day. Thinking up various daily routines I could follow and how that would make me into a superhuman somehow made me shameful for not doing all of that. And this again made the temptation for distraction more and more powerful.",171,motivation / planning
7xzy1f,"In this way, schedules, planning and motivation became just another form of escape. Just another drug for my brain.",171,motivation / planning
7xzy1f,"And I finally realized what discipline actually is: It is the ability to recognize anxiety/shame/whatever as a signal from the brain that there is a problem that needs your attention, and immediately go about solving it. It is about recognizing your brain telling you to seek distraction, and paying attention to what is actually happening. What are you telling yourself? What reason are you giving yourself to procrastinate? Can you override it a bit this time? If you do, it will be easier next time. And if you do it enough, you'll start being someone who takes action immediately.",194,procrastinate / procrastination
7xzy1f,"My biggest reason for procrastination is that I constantly worked out problems in an imaginary, predictable future. I didn't attend what was right in front of me. I made schedules, plans and goals that were motivating to fantasize about, but that actually intensified my shame and anxiety every time I failed to realize them, prompting me to distract myself.",194,procrastinate / procrastination
7xzy1f,"One important realization that I made was that many of my goals and dreams were false. They exist in a fantasy world based on fantasy ideas about what makes me happy, and what is meaningful. The truth is that I don't know my SMART goals for something I've never done. I don't know anything. I only know that I have a gut feeling that tells me I want to try out something vaguely defined. And that's ok! That's all I need. The future doesn't exist. The only time I can take action is right now. I can't fail, because I have no idea what constitutes success. I only learn this by doing something.",192,goals / goal
7xzy1f,"It's actually terribly obvious. When I play video games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, I don't sit down and schedule my day in order to achieve a certain armor or weapon. Still, I work extremely systematically. It appears organically.",199,work / doing
7xzy1f,This is what discipline is. Listening to yourself and acting in line with what you want right here and now.,70,discipline / disciplined
7xzy1f,"So does this work? So far, yes. I take action more often, I've done things recently that I've put off for years due to some vague idea that I need to plan how to do it. Turns out I just needed to get started. Not only that, but I'm a lot more content these days. I no longer have the same feeling in my gut of impending failure, or some sort of time pressure to live up to whatever standards I set. I still make plans and use methods - but I use these to solve problems I've already initiated working on, where there's some momentum.",-1,life / just
7xzy1f,"My point with this post is... I don't know, I wanted to share my experience with someone else. See if anyone else sees themselves in this post.

lktxp7,"* If you have the ability to extend deadlines without consequences, do it. It's easier to fight one-on-one. Extend the deadlines to help you focus on the current fight, but don't abuse it. Once you're done with your current fight, chase down your next opponent or else they'll gang up and eventually corner you.",-1,life / just

lktxp7,"* Prioritize the deadliest opponents. If one of your opponents has a gun, you better take them out quickly. This is an analogy to tasks with the highest pressure consequences (final exams, big projects at work, ...)",201,fight / opponents
lktxp7,"* Always fight one-on-one. Focus on what's in front of you, one task at a time. Forget about the other tasks while you're already working on one. Writing what needs to be done in a list helps with that - it gives your brain the permission to temporarily forget about all the other things that need to be done.",184,task / tasks

lktxp7,"If you didn't read a single thing. Just remember to keep fighting. If you see yourself running (procrastinating) or freezing, stop running, stop freezing, fight even if you have no chance, fight until death. Once you've defeated all the opponents coming to get you, become a predator yourself. Seek out tasks to fight. In real life, this translates into taking initiative.",201,fight / opponents

d6ji86,"**1) Love yourself.** You deserve the best. You should strive for your potential - the most fulfilled version of yourself - and that potential is virtually limitless. This is the single most important mindset to adopt, as it serves as a foundation for literally everything else. It’s not a case of arrogance or entitlement, but in the sense that you would want the best for a family member of SO that you deeply love. A lot of people self-sabotage (often inadvertently), and complain that they can’t break free of negative habits… I believe this is largely due to the fact that deep down they’ve built up so much self-hatred that they don’t even feel worthy of attaining their goals and living their most fulfilling life. Fuck that. I don’t care what your backstory is, you are worthy. I am. We all are. You wouldn’t be reading this if you didn’t believe you were.",141,family / love
d6ji86,"**2)** **Understand that you are the architect of your fate.** A lot of people adopt a fatalistic mindset as a coping mechanism, but instead believe that you can achieve anything you set your mind to, and let go of limiting beliefs. Sounds like some bombastic BS you were told in primary school before reality hit you like a ton of bricks right? I thought so too since I’m a rational minded guy, but then I realized there’s literally no sense in not believing that. Yeah you’ll probably never win Mr Olympia, you’ll probably never be a billionaire, you’ll probably never be entirely content with the choices you’ve made  – but that shouldn’t stop you from trying to attain your aspirations and realize your ~~dreams~~ potential. Dreams are passive not proactive. No matter how disastrous your position may seem, I can guarantee that people in worse positions have gone on to achieve their goals through the adoption of principles not unlike these. Use that as inspiration.",-1,life / just
d6ji86,"Also remember that no matter how ‘unfair’ life has been to you; whether you were born crippled, had to bury your child, were wrongly imprisoned for 20 years – you are the only one who can help yourself now, so long as there’s a will, which ties back to the first principle. When life gives you lemons, you can either squeeze them in your eyes, or make lemonade…you can’t change the hand you’ve been given, but you decide how to play it. You’re not responsible for all the things that befall you, but you’re entirely responsible for how you deal with them, which in turn will determine future events. So in this sense, whilst a few pages will be torn, you can write your future. This notion should be empowering, not daunting.",-1,life / just
d6ji86,"Be mindful that whilst learning from the past, and planning for the future you should still very much be living in the present.

It's a rather shit way to watch a movie. There are valid reasons why one may attempt to avoid the present - pain, grief, anticipation, yearning and so on - but these headspaces are like quicksand in that the longer you allow yourself to wallow in them the deeper you'll sink, and the harder it will become to return to the present.

Here are two techniques you can use to confront that pessimistic voice;",-1,life / just
d6ji86,"1 **Retroactive self-reflection**. Here’s a confronting visualization activity to motivate you into taking action; When faced with a daunting decision or challenge (one that you want to take but are hampered by your negative thoughts), envision yourself as an old folk – Zimmer frame, toothless, baby food, incontinent, lonely, family only drop in once a month if you’re lucky – and you’re propped in front of the TV, but you’re not watching daytime talk shows, rather you’re viewing a montage of all the opportunities you’ve passed up in your younger life, and you’re writhing with regret because you’ll never know what could have been. Attach this scenario to a word or phrase you can mutter so you’re not actually trying to imagine an old man shitting himself when you’re at a critical moment. Remember two adages; If you try you risk failure, if you back out you assure it; rejection stings for a minute (perhaps even a month), but regret will haunt you for a lifetime.",-1,life / just
d6ji86,"2 **Explicitly stating negative behaviors before or whilst you’re engaging in them**. For instance “I’m going to procrastinate on reddit for the rest of the evening,  then panic tomorrow afternoon when I realize the assignment Is due in a few hours and I haven't even started”, “I’m going to allow a spiteful comment to ruin my entire day because my self-worth is completely dependent on what a stranger thinks of me” “I’m now going to go masturbate to some unrealistic BS for 40 seconds of mild pleasure then feel utterly awful afterwards, and ruin one of my socks in the process” . Make sure to articulate it in a silly voice so it highlights how ridiculous that line of thinking is, and separates it from the self that wants to improve i.e. the true self. If you're anything like me, you'll actually struggle to even get the full thing out before you're launching a counterattack.",-1,life / just
d6ji86,"**7) Interrupt negative thoughts with positive ones.** Just as the former pervade your mind whenever you consider a possibility or opportunity, you can give them a taste of their own medicine by interrupting them with optimism. For instance fellas; you see a gorgeous, friendly looking girl browsing a few meters away at the supermarket, you make eye contact and she briefly smiles at you…your immediate response is actually to approach her…but that thought is swiftly interrupted by “What if she thinks I’m creepy? What if this complete stranger laughs at my face? What if I shit my pants and vomit on her?” The solution; interrupt those pessimistic thoughts instantaneously with “or what if we have incredibly chemistry, we’re exactly what the other one has been searching for, and we fall into a passionate romance that develops into a lifelong partnership?” or “so what if that happens? If she thinks I’m creepy I’ll know I need to work on how I project myself. If she laughs at me I will have dodged a bullet. If I shit myself and vomit I’ll become more resilient for it as I will have survived the worst case scenario.” So put yourself outside your comfort zone, and into situations where you’ll have the opportunity to silence that naysaying motherfucker...then to really spite it, take action.",-1,life / just

d6ji86,"**8)** **Positively reframe situations.** Similar to the previous point, but more generalized. Instead of looking at the gym as a place of sweat and pain, look at it as a place for strengthening the body and mind. Instead of looking at a job interview as a torturous exercise in awkward silences,  humble bragging, and sycophantism, look at is as an opportunity to improve the way you project yourself, fortify mental resilience, and potentially enter a fulfilling career. Instead of telling yourself ‘I can’t do this’ or ‘I’m terrible at this’ include the addendum ‘yet’ and ‘but, I can learn’.  Learn to enjoy challenges as they become opportunities for either success or learning. Look at failures as chances for error correction and personal growth. Learn to deal with setbacks and failures constructively, without giving up and reverting back to detrimental habits. Don’t expect yourself to fail, but don’t lambaste yourself if you do – treat it all as a learning exercise. Many are scared to try their absolute hardest in the fear that they may still ‘fail’ – however the silver lining in this situation is that you’ve now experienced the worst case scenario and lived to tell the tale, thus you become more resilient to future failures, and are able to focus on identifying causes rather than the act itself.  After all, humanity has progressed on the back of countless failures, but wouldn’t have if they were never capitalized as learning opportunities.",-1,life / just

Don’t expect to go from a lazy, unstructured layabout to Mr Efficiency overnight, over a week, over a month, even over a year – this is placing (often deliberately) unrealistic expectations on yourself and setting yourself up for disappointment. Deeply ingrained negative thought loops and harmful habits take time to overcome and redirect into positive ones. Our brains are adaptable and It will happen eventually, but it’s done incrementally, and it takes time, consistency and resolve. Divide large tasks into manageable chunks; a series of sprints rather than trying to run the marathon. Everyone runs their own race at their own pace – don’t exclusively compare your progress to that of somebody else, no matter how similar you believe yourselves to be. The only person you should truly compare yourself to is your younger self.

Commend yourself for achievements, but don’t chastise yourself over those you didn’t. This is crucial in building self-efficacy, and eventually it will become habitual. Try to minimize the concessions you give yourself;  “Today is gonna be a lazy day, I’ll get back on top of things tomorrow” but don’t allow a slip up to completely ruin any momentum and progress you’ve made. You’re only human, and even the most productive people have ‘lazy days’  – plus self-disgust isn’t a sustainable motivator to improve.  Nonetheless, endeavor to remain mindful of what you’re doing as often as possible, and gently guide yourself back on track if you’ve become derailed. At the other end of the spectrum, thrive on the liberating moments where you've managed to turn off autopilot and take the reins of your own life - use this to drive further constructive behavior.",-1,life / just
