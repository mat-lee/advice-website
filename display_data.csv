Make sure you're getting as much sleep as you possibly can. Seriously. Make an effort to sleep more. Simply training harder in the gym isn't going to yield results like just resting more does.,Sleep Recovery,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.9,0.8,0.9,0.9,0.87
"Set a bodyweight you want to bulk up to. Be it 10, 15, or 20 or more pounds above where you are now. And once you get there just stay there for a bit. This is the biggest error I see when guys and gals bulk. They get to their goal bulk weight and instantly start cutting. Don't do this! Get big and stay there a bit. Milk those gains for as long as you can. I suggest three months because in that span you could start and finish a pretty good training cycle that incorporates different training phases; hypertrophy and strength, for example. Once that training cycle is complete then you have my permission to cut.",Bulking Strategy,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.6,0.76

"Lots of volume! From what I've experienced training myself and others is that things like bench and overhead press require a bit more volume than what you would expect- or what common off-the-shelf programs have written. So if you're doing something like Starting Strength perhaps try to add three sets or so of bench at the end of your work out, maybe around 65% of the weight you used earlier that workout.",Bench Volume,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.7,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.65
"Get your arms BIGGER! Seriously. Bigger arms = a bigger bench. I'm talking about both your biceps and triceps. By making your biceps bigger you're going to make the elbow joint more stable.

"The control of the bar on the way down is imperative. If it does not land in the right spot on your chest it is going to be that much more difficult to complete the lift. An inefficient landing zone means that by the time you get it 1/2 way up you're already out of gas. Control on the descent is key. The bar should always touch in the same spot.

You're going to want to have a very strong back. My go-to is pull ups. Why? Cause they're easy to recover from. They're fun. And they train your lats like a mofuggah and those things are kind of a big deal.,Back Strength,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.6,0.69
Spend a few weeks working from a deficit of 1-3 inches. Practice some heavy pulls from that deficit. Easiest way to do this is to just stand on one plate or two while the bar rests on the floor. This makes it much more difficult breaking the bar off the floor and it also does a wonderful job of strengthening your back.,Deficit Pulls,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.7,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.65
Then I would do some more volume work from the floor. Just standard deadlifts here for reps. Five or less reps at a time here and around 5 or so sets. The fewer the reps per set you want to do the more weight you should be handling.,Deadlift Volume,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.7,0.7,0.7,0.5,0.64
Train with and without a belt too. Nothing makes your abs stronger than working some moderately heavy deadlifts without a belt. This helps you focus on proper bracing and breath control.,Belt Training,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.6,0.69
If you cannot brace and position yourself correctly before the start of the pull then it's going to be so much harder to get it off the ground. Position yourself properly and jettison that bar into orbit because you're about to rip that bar off the ground.,Setup Bracing,Fitness,3fp96f,3225,0.89,r/Fitness,0.7,0.6,0.6,0.5,0.59

"For relatively short efforts (like a heavy set of 5) the aerobic system is producing almost a third of the energy needed, and for higher rep sets, it’s producing more than half the energy. The implication: The more powerful your aerobic energy system, the more reps you’ll be able to do with a given weight or percentage of your max, because every bit of energy you can produce aerobically is that much less that you have to produce anaerobically, which pushes off those factors that cause acute muscular fatigue. Also, if you do the same number of reps with a given amount of weight, less of the energetic contribution will come from your anaerobic energy systems, so the set will be less fatiguing. So you’re either looking at more work and the same fatigue, or the same amount of work with less fatigue; either way, you win.",Improve Reps and Fatigue,Fitness,7xjdq6,2591,0.95,r/Fitness,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.73

"Change Your Life 1 Small Step at a Time Change rarely comes from giant leaps. Instead, it comes through small decisions made day-after-day. I used to have an all-or-nothing mentality. And that resulted in me getting stuck in a vicious cycle: First, I would work extremely hard towards changing my life for a few days or weeks. Then, I would burn out and not do anything for a long period. After doing nothing for a while, I would feel the need to make a change again. And would repeat the cycle. I finally got out of that cycle when I started focusing on making small changes. Changes that were small enough that I could keep up with them in the long-term. Here’s how to do that: Prioritize your goals: You can’t do it all at once. Often it helps to just focus on 1 new change at a time. When starting a new habit, go as tiny as possible: For example, if you want to start meditating, don’t try to do 30 minutes a day. Instead, start with something smaller. Like 1 minute. Wait until you’ve formed a strong habit before you start making things more challenging. Have specific, tangible goals: You are much more likely to follow through with a small, specific goal, than a broad, vague plan. For example, you are not that likely to commit to something general, like I want to learn programming. But you are much more likely to commit to something specific, like I am going to watch this introduction to JavaScript tutorial tomorrow morning.

Have a regular schedule: Wake up and go to bed at similar times each day. And consider having regular morning and night routines you follow.

Don't try to meditate an hour a day, instead start with meditating just 5 minutes a day. Don't do 100 sit ups a day, just do 10 sit ups a day. Over time, you will train your brain to get in the habit of whatever you are doing. And in the long-run the small amount you do each day will add up to huge results.

Start a streak I started a streak for reading. Nothing elaborate. Just 5 minutes of reading daily. First got to 35 days and accidentally broke it off on a weekend.

Also I'm not in a rush to finish 100 books like many productivity blogs and their uncles advocate. I don't believe in quantity. The most impactful books took me at least a month to read and that was because I intentionally paused to try some lessons in the book before coming back to it.

"If your home living situation was not abusive and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). You can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own. If things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. Some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer. If you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. Maybe they are not great people. Maybe you don't believe in the same things. As long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent. As they say, the best revenge is living a good life.",Housing Options,Home Management,bgv0wy,16649,0.94,r/personalfinance,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.79
"It's generally illegal for your parent(s) or guardian to actually kick you out. If your home living situation was not abusive, one option to consider is contacting the police to get back into your home. If you're an underage child (under 18 in most of the United States) and not legally emancipated, it's almost always illegal for parent(s) or a guardian to kick you out. Even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. The specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well). Contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. You shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you or in your room if you contact the police.",Housing Options,Home Management,bgv0wy,16649,0.94,r/personalfinance,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.73
"If you have any relatives that you can reach that would let you stay with them for any period of time, this is one of the best available options if you've been kicked out.

"I became a learning machine. I read about 100 books a year at this point in my life. And I read many more articles. I started doing this because I read an article talking about the reading habits of successful people. Turns out Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Oprah, and many more billionaires are ferocious readers. For example, Warren Buffett was once asked about the key to success. He pointed to a stack of nearby books and said, 'Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.' As far as procrastination is concerned, reading helps because it teaches me about concepts related to procrastination. For example, reading taught me about meditation and mindfulness. It taught me about self-compassion. It taught me about deliberate practice. It taught me about emotion regulation. These concepts all help me beat procrastination in one way or another.

"Read books that actually interest you Let me get real with you for a second: I was horrible at school. Elementary school, best of the class. High school? Worst. College? I dropped out after year 2. Where am I today? Well, most people expect you to be either homeless or Bill Gates. I'm in between, but a lot closer to Bill Gates than being homeless. I run two agencies and spend my time between both of them. Why is this important? Because high school and college made me hate reading. I would rather spend my days playing video games than reading a book. But it wasn't until I started reading books that I found interesting that I found my way back into reading and studying. See, school teaches you to read books for information that you will then get tested on and potentially forget all of it by the end of the semester. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of degrees that you need a ton of knowledge for, but not every degree is like that - and what if you end up not wanting to pursue your degree after college or potentially aren't able to because there are no jobs available right now?

"Negative visualization despite the name is an exercise that will increase your default level of happiness if practised consistently. The exercise consists of you envisioning what it would feel like if you lost certain things from your life. Some of the things that you could consider during the exercise are: How it would feel to not have a roof over your head. How it would feel to lose social status. How it would feel to live in a third world country. How it would feel to have a physical disability. How it would feel to lose a loved one. This exercise is not meant to be dark or morbid, it's meant to put things into perspective. Allowing you to see how lucky you truly are. It also prepares you for the worst case scenarios in which one of these things does happen. You are not meant to fixate on these thoughts, but consider them from time to time.

"Meditation is the practice of sitting for any given amount of time and staying aware/witnessing your brain. If you can only meditate for 2 minutes at a time right now, then that’s fine. Just sit and stay aware of the thoughts that come up and right when you notice the thought, bring your focus to something happening in the moment. Your breath, the feeling of your feet on the floor, anything that’s happening now. In practice, you’ll start to notice when your brain is trailing off in everyday life. When you’re reading a book and your brain starts thinking about something else, you’ll start to notice that and be able to bring your focus back. As you meditate consistently, it’ll become faster and easier to do so. It’ll help in LITERALLY everything you do every single day. It will make it so much easier to make decisions from a conscious state as opposed to constantly living in an unconscious state.

"You need to understand that whatever you desire is already yours in the future. See, there are always two ways to move forward in life. First is you trying to get something, failing a few times and then thinking that maybe it’s not for you. The other is to believe that whatever you truly desire is already yours in the near future, but it’s on you to figure out a way to reach it. Imagine yourself in amaze, you are on the starting point and on the ending point is your desire. So you basically just have to figure out how to reach it. When you go through the maze, you will hit a dead end multiple times, but you’ll have to keep believing that there is a way. It’s not like you failing is the end of things, consider it as actually a door being closed so that there are even less doors to focus on.",Future Visualization,Mental Health,1f5njk4,1147,0.97,r/getdisciplined,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.7,0.69

"Delaying gratification only means that we don't act on some of our wants until later, which still leaves a whole world of wants that we can act on right now. For example, studying might require that you delay the gratification of scrolling through social media for a while. But while delaying the scrolling gratification, you can still get the gratification of hanging out with people if you decide to study with your friends. In framing the question surrounding delayed gratification not as, 'what do I have to give up?' but as, 'what can I still get?' you can creatively come up with ways to make the process of delaying gratification a whole lot more fun.",Balance Gratification,Mental Health,nvd4u0,667,0.99,r/productivity,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.7,0.77

"By building a relationship with your future self and by seeing your future self as your current self, just in a different context, it'll be easier for you to delay gratification and to do things to help out your future self because ultimately, you're helping you. If you have trouble imagining your future self, you can put a picture of yourself through an aging filter to what your future self may look like. You can interact with your short-term future self by delaying gratification in small ways that have a practically immediate benefit. For example, you can delay the immediate gratification of hopping into bed by setting up the coffee machine so that when you wake up the next morning, you can get your coffee without any hassle. In building a relationship with your future self, it's important that you consciously acknowledge when you're doing something for your future self and that you consciously acknowledge when you've reaped some benefit from the efforts of your past self. So, when you're setting up the coffee machine at night, think, 'I am doing this for my future self,' and when you wake up the next morning to a fully prepped coffee machine, thank your past self.",Future Self,Mental Health,nvd4u0,667,0.99,r/productivity,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.79

People complain that they diet and exercise but don't lose weight... well if you are counting exercise towards your diet and use MFP for that, I'm not surprised! Second of all, I'm of the opinion that if you're trying to lose weight, why run 3 miles and then eat those extra 300 calories? You could be losing weight by keeping that deficit. As long as you're eating at least the minimum your body needs, you don't have to replenished those calories burned through exercise.

"Don’t Hold on to Your Old Identity In order to truly change, you need to let go of your Past Self. Do you have to let go of everything? Of course not. But you do want to shed the notion that you ARE fundamentally a certain way. For example: I am an awkward person. I am an undisciplined person. Or I am an out-of-shape person. Once you let go of your old identity, it is going to be easier to start forming new identities. Such as: I am a confident person. I am a disciplined person. Or I am a healthy person. Of course, you are going to have to couple this mindset shift with making actions that match.

"Don’t Compare Your Life to Other People’s Lives When I was in my early to mid-20s, there was one thing I could always count on making me feel bad: Comparing where I was in life to where other people at a similar life stage were. Thoughts would enter my head like: Why haven’t I found as much happiness in relationships? A lot of people I know have had successful relationships by now. I still have no idea what I want to do with my career. But I just read about a billionaire CEO who is only 25 years old. And now I feel worse about myself. How come some people I know are so confident in social situations, yet I am more awkward? I wish my social skills were as good as theirs. And you know where these kinds of thoughts got me? Absolutely nowhere. Once I finally stopped comparing myself to others, it became easier to focus on the things I could control.

Increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your street, increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your country. Keep going until you can picture a view of Earth from the stars. With this scale, we can gain a better perspective on the insignificance of our problems. When compared to the universe whatever problems we might appear incredibly trivial.

Let's say you want to start weightlifting. If you just do it to 'build muscle' but you don't like the act of weightlifting itself, it's unlikely you will motivate yourself to stick with weightlifting long enough to build the muscle you desire (and even if you do you will be miserable doing it). But if you learn to actually enjoy lifting weights, and focus more on that, you are going to be happier and more likely to stick with weightlifting for longer.

I could batch writing for one part of the day, I could batch editing videos for one part of the day, etc. ii) Schedule your deep work block as early in the day as possible because that is when you will inevitably do the best, as you have most of the energy at that time. iii) Schedule buffer and contingency - basically to summarize this point, we should know that we underestimate the time we waste and overestimate the time that we are productive for.

For example, if you have to take a dump or if you have to brush, do not also choose to fill that up with reading or listening to something. Just give your brain the time to think and relax if it will, from any cognitive load. So that your brain can learn or give you solid ideas in that free time that you give it.

For your own example when you are out in the car, do not choose to have your phone in hand and to begin scrolling, just think, or relax even but do not multi-task then, because your brain will get fried.

"I hate that I was 33 when I learned about setting S.M.A.R.T goals from one of my Master Chiefs. This model is stupid simple, yet highly effective. Just follow along, you'll get it: Specific Your goal must be clear and precise What exactly do you want to achieve? No vague objectives EX: Instead of saying 'I want to get in shape,' I would start with 'I want to do 10 pull-ups.' It's a specific number, instead of something arbitrary, meaning you now have a set number you can reach Measurable This is your time-table. How will you track it? There MUST be a realistic way to track it on paper, or on an Excel spreadsheet, or a Word document. Something material This is the equivalent of quarterly reviews in business EX: Currently I can do 0 pull-ups, and I want to do 10 pull-ups. That means by March (The date is currently 23FEB2025), I'd like to work my way up to 1 pull-up, and if I continue exercising and monitoring my diet, I should be able to do 3 pull-ups by May. This is part of tracking Achievable Is this doable? If you've never done a single pull-up in your life, and you weigh 210 pounds with very little muscle, it is absolutely unreasonable to say 'I want to do 10 pull-ups by next month' because you need to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to develop the necessary muscles to achieve that goal Start small. Don't take on a marathon if you can barely run a mile Realistic/Relevant Make sure the goal aligns with your life, your values, or your objectives. I'm in the Military, so it makes sense I would set personal fitness goals Make sure it's worth your time and effort. There is no reason for me to want to learn how to speak Vietnamese, it's irrelevant to my life Make sure it's a realistic goal. I had terrible grades in High School, I'm unfocused, and I'm a college drop-out. There is no world where I will look at my peers and say 'I want to study Law at Harvard' without getting laughed out of the room Timeliness Set a deadline. I want to do 10 pull-ups. Okay, when?

Timetune allows you to turn off entire routines of alarms (so if you have a day off you don't have to remove 10 alarms at once and remember to add 10 alarms the next day), and it allows you to choose much less obstructive sound-cues if you just need a quick audible beep versus a much more unpleasant and invasive wakeup-alarm.",Time Tools,Planning,kxe8bp,1107,0.99,r/productivity,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.5,0.71

I vouch for PassionPlanner, personally, but I've also moved on to finding other Agenda planners that you can order online, that allow you to choose the layout of your pages. In addition, find the pens that you want to use. It has to feel good for us to use it. You have to turn your planner into something you have fun using, and want to use.

Meta-detailing has to do with going 'higher' up what is called the 'meta-stack' until we get to what really motivates us, and using it as motivation for what we need to do. For example, I need to study for my normal course work. I don't feel motivated, so I move higher up. I tell myself that it's actually so I'll pass my exams. I still don't feel motivated. So I go higher. It's so I'll get a great, awesome job tomorrow. I still don't feel motivated. So I go higher. Getting a great job is so that I can have a great, successful FAMILY. SUDDENLY I feel awesomely motivated. FAMILY resonates more with my subconscious, and I never knew it. Truth is, our conscious mind decides what we need to do, but all motivation is from our subconscious mind. This is why we can decide what to do, but we might not feel like doing it at all when the time comes. So, when I need to read, I tell myself. THIS READING IS SO YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT FAMILY... and suddenly, I am motivated. That works for me. Something else would work for you, just make sure you keep moving on the stack till you find it, and use it.",Meta-Detailing,Planning,de67d5,662,0.94,r/productivity,0.7,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.77

"Improve Your Social Skills I used to be incredibly awkward in social situations. My awkwardness was particularly severe during high school and in college. But continued to an extent through my mid-20s. It wasn’t until I started consciously working on developing my social abilities, that my awkwardness started to diminish. Here are some keys to improving your social skills: Go outside of your comfort zone: In my mid-20s, I made a conscious effort to try to be more social than I had been and to meet new people. And as a result, I made some great connections. Open Up: I used to be more closed off. Unless I was around my close friends, I tended to shut down. For a long time, that held me back, because people are attracted to genuineness. Once I started opening up more, it helped me develop closer relationships. Listen: I used to be a horrible listener. Becoming a better listener has led to much deeper and better conversations, both personally and professionally.

I have a hard time going to the gym by myself, no matter how much I want to work out. So I have gathered two people around me to work out with. Either I go with one or both, but I hardly ever go alone. The day before I text them: 'Gym tomorrow 8 AM?'. Sometimes both will go with me, sometimes only one will go with me.

"Keep things secret. Now, maybe you are not a very secretive person. You want to tell everything to everyone, but that’s not a very good idea, and why am saying this is because a lot of times, people who are really close to you cannot see you suffer. For instance, let’s say you are posting on a social media platform every day for months without seeing any progress and you have told your family, your friends, and they all are tracking your progress. Waiting for you to succeed, but when they see you working hard, struggling every day, posting a video, reels or a short every day, without obvious progress, they might start feeling sorry for you, and they might start telling you that you should explore other options, even though you yourself might be seeing a slight change in your analytics, which might be a ray of hope for you. The thing is, no matter what we say, people around us who care for us and who we care for can actually impact your progress unknowingly, So if it’s not absolutely important, I would suggest that you keep your things secret for the sake of your mental health.",Maintain Privacy,Safety,1f5njk4,1147,0.97,r/getdisciplined,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.73

"Stop saying 'I hate my life' - as a rule. Because you don't. You hate what it has come to. You hate what you have made of it. You hate the abuse that has been committed against you. Unless you are out living in a war zone or dictatorship (basically, a situation you did not choose, of an enormity you cannot change and trying to protest will get you killed). If you live a regular life, with a regular job, a regular family, regular problems of varying scales that aren't unheard of - that is, the life of every other person complaining about their life on the internet - if you live that life, stop saying 'I hate my life' as a rule. If you have started feeling disenchanted with life, identify the reasons why instead of a general hate for everything in your life. Why do I feel like I hate my life? What about it can I change?

If you are the same person that you were in the past when you got rejected, you will get rejected again. If you are a different, better person - the chances of getting rejected because of you drastically reduce. You are a brain and a body. You are a human. Nothing more, nothing less. Why will you not get a partner? Why will you not have a family? Why will you not get a job?

"I am toxic because I choose to be so. Negative situations in life like unnatural death of loved ones, an abusive partner, humiliation due to social status etc often embitter people to the point that their reaction to that negative situation becomes their whole personality. It is favourable for evolution that we learn from our past mistakes and put our guards up. But, being embittered and cynical and hateful only drives away all potentially positive experiences away from you. For example, if you start 'hating all women' because one girlfriend cheated on you - you are actively driving away good women from entering your life. Negative situations induce negative reactions. But you choose your reaction. You choose its length.
