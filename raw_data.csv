9t0gqz,"Hi, I wish to share my journey of getting disciplined. I hope you will take something away from this :). I would like to mention that I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me for any grammar and/or spelling mistakes.

TLDR; Build positive habits on a foundation of willpower, not motivation.

Start reading non-fiction and apply it in your life. Work on your physiology, it should be the foundation for productivity and discipline.

Lessen the amount of superstimuli in your life to get more dopamine (motivation).

Flow activities should be the goal in life, not mind numbing pleasure.

Start a bullet journal where you color code all activities you do each day positive or negative.

It all started when I realized I had hit rock bottom. I was getting up at 3pm everyday. Only ate junkfood, lay in bed watching YouTube and smoking a lot of weed. My room was always a complete mess. I completely disregarded my study while I was living of a study loan. Every night I would hang out with a friend who would do the same and we'd smoke weed and watch screens until about 5 am. It really was rock bottom. This went on for a long time until I saw I had to change my life.

# HABIT BUILDING

I read a book called The Slight Edge. The idea of the book was that with consistent, incremental improvement, anyone could reach anything. It also debunked the idea of a 'quantum leap', which at first I believed in. I liked the idea and started implementing it to form positive habits in my life. I started with nofap, meditation, reading, cleaning and some more. I made a lot of mistakes when I first started out. So some advice on habit building I have accumulated is this:

DON'T TRUST MOTIVATION. Motivation is good if it's there but it shouldn't be the foundation of the habits you create. Why? because motivation isn't always there, and when it's gone you also lose the habits that you build on top of it. I experienced this a lot of times. I would have a streak of 100+ days meditation, miss 3 days and completely give up until I had the motivation again to start over.

So how can I build habits then? Do it based on willpower. The big difference is not to say to yourself ""I'm gonna read 20 pages every day because I'm so motivated to gain knowledge."" But that you say ""I'm going force myself to start reading everyday because I will have enough willpower to always do that.""

The key is that if you make the requirement so small that you can always do it, you will never fail. So doing for example 1 pushup everyday. You will never fail that requirement. But if you have very little motivation one day and think about doing 20 pushups, it just seems intimidating and you don't do it.

Some people might say ""only starting to read or doing 1 push up will never get me anywhere."" And I agree, but the thing is that you can do more. And you will usually do more. Once you forced yourself, with willpower, to get into push up position and do 1 push up, you'll probably think ""I can do one more, and one more"" and so on. Same for reading, once you've forced yourself to sit in a chair with a book and started reading, you wont stop after just 1 word. You will do a lot more than the initial requirement more times then not. It will also give you a sense of ""I did this"". Especially if your requirement is, say, 1 push up, and you do 10. You will have done 9 extra. As opposed to when you require yourself to do 20 and do 10. You will have done 10 too little.

Try it right now, force yourself on the ground to do one push up. I'm sure you have the willpower to do that.

The key is to make the requirement so small you will never fail it. Build the habit on a foundation of willpower, if motivation comes along, that's great.

# READING

The one habit that has done the most for my life is to read non-fiction. I bought an e-reader and started to read daily. I recommend buying an e-reader a lot. Here are some of the benefits:

\- Very portable, whenever I'm in public transport I pull it out and read some pages.

\- Buying books is instant and you can read anything you'd like

\- If you have little money there are a lot of places where you can download ebooks for free

\- It has a backlight, so you can read in your bed, lying on your side, in the dark. Most come with blue light filters as well.

Some of the benefits of reading non-fiction

\- You can learn directly from great people

\- There are books on anything that you find interesting (for me it's psychology)

\- There are a lot of self-help books on the market that will give you advice that you can practically apply in your life.

I'm sure there are a lot more, but for the sake of not writing a book as a post this will do.

I think the most important thing as a prerequisite for discipline is good physiology. If you aren't feeling good it's hard to do things that would count as disciplined behavior. So that's why I would recommend reading some books about physiology.

Books that have had a profound impact on my life are; Mini habits, Meet Your Happy Chemicals, The HeartMath Solution, The Willpower Instinct, Cupid's Poisoned Arrow, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and Awareness Through Movement.

If your read all these books you will learn; how to create healthy habits in your life without making it hard; how your brain chemicals work; how to instantly lower stress and deal with negative thought and emotion, how willpower works, why it matters and how to get more of it; how orgasm induces neurochemical brain changes for 2 weeks and how it's evolutionary designed to break romantic relationships; what a flow experience is, and why it should be the goal for all activities in life to turn into one; that everyone stops progressing in the most basic things like breathing, posture etc. because only the minimal in life is needed to get on, it also provides lessons on how to improve these parts of life.

Gaining knowledge in this field will give you the ability to make the changes in your life that will benefit your overall feeling. Feeling good overall, in your body and mind, is required for doing productive things.

# DOPAMINE

I'm a psychology student so when I got into self help I was naturally interested in the brain's place in self improvement.

Dopamine is the key player here. Most people think dopamine is responsible for 'pleasure'. This is a big misunderstanding. Dopamine is actually responsible for 'wanting' and motivation.

When the dopamine part of the brain was first discovered, it was discovered in rats. The researchers hooked up a lever to the rats' dopamine circuit to shock the dopamine circuit (mimicking dopamine release) whenever the rats would pull the lever. The rats soon ignored anything else and only pulled the lever until they died of starvation and fatigue. Next the researchers (this one is a bit cruel) would have 2 levers on the opposite sides of a cage that would produce a 'dopamine hit' if pressed after the other. To make it interesting they put an electrically charged grid in between that would give the rats a painful shock if they walked over it. So now the rats would have to cross the grid every time they wanted another 'dopamine hit'. Shockingly (lol) the rats would run across it until they burned of their legs and couldn't walk anymore. The researchers concluded from these experiments that this dopamine circuit was responsible for creating pleasure. Nowadays this is proved to be wrong and the actual function of the dopamine circuit is believed to be wanting and motivation.

Most things people like to do give a lot of dopamine (much more than anything would have given in nature). Things like watching TV (or netflix), internet, drugs, processed foods, porn, gambling and videogames. Things that give us a lot of dopamine tend to be addicting. No wonder I was only smoking, watching screens and lying in bed when I hit rock bottom.

Now, why should you care? The reason is very simple. Exposure to high dopamine for longer periods of time REDUCES DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. Lower dopamine receptors give you lower motivation, lower concentration and less mental sharpness. With there being a lot of supernaturally high dopamine giving activities and substances available to us we should all be aware in what amount we should consume them. This is the reason why there are more college and university dropouts more than ever before. Why so many people are unhappy at work. And why there are more cases of depression than ever before (depression is linked to lower dopamine).

Big companies know about this and use it to sell us as much as possible and keep them on their platforms for longer. They put the exact amount of sugar in all foods so that we like it the most, they design their platforms so you stay on them a lot (Facebook and Instagram), they implement gambling into games so that we play them more (Fortnite).

So what to take away from all this? Lessen the amount of activities you do each day that give you a lot of dopamine and don't add anything to your life. This will give you a natural amount of dopamine receptors again and will make it a lot easier to stay concentrated while reading or learning an instrument for example.

# FLOW ACTIVITIES

1 book that has made a profound impact on my life is the book Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience. The idea of the book is that there are certain activities that for which your brain needs 100% of  it's power to be focused on the activity. This is when you reach a 'Flow state'. In this state you lose the idea of the self, you lose track of time and are only focused on the task at hand. For example when you drive somewhere and you get there and don't remember how you got there.

Flow occurs when your skill matches the challenge of the activity. When your skill is too high, you will be bored, when the challenge is too high you will be anxious.

The key idea from this book, for me, was the difference between pleasure and enjoyment. Pleasure activities are ones that give the high amount of dopamine. Whereas enjoyable activities also give dopamine, but also make you better at the task and will often produce a state of Flow. Enjoyment produces growth, pleasure does not.

I think that any activity in life that is not a pure pleasure activity can be made into a flow activity. It's one of my goals in life to fill my day with enjoyable activities. It made me realize I wanted to fill my day with making music and reading, not with smoking and watching TV.

# JOURNALING

One of the best habits I have build is journaling. More specifically bullet journaling. I'm not sure if this is the official way to do it but this is what I do and what works for me.

People pay coaches a lot of money to do something they can do themselves as well; give feedback. All a coach does is tell you what you've done, and where you can improve. This is something you can do yourself easily by bullet journaling.

My method: I have a simple notebook where I use the left and right page for 1 day. In the morning I write down some things I want to do that day on the left page. If there are things I wanted to do yesterday I write them down for today. I also write a bit about how I feel. Recently I've been doing some affirmations as well on that page. You can skip this entire left page, I personally like it, but I can understand how it's a bit much for some people. You could also experiment with it and change it up how you like it.

The real magic (and the reason I made the coach analogy) is on the right page. Here is where I write down every influential activity I do. I won't write down things like 'have breakfast' or 'short chat with roommate'. I write down everything that has a positive or a negative meaning (some things are neutral like doing groceries). Then at the end of the day I will use a marker to color code every activity either green (positive) or red (negative). So for example:

(green) get up at 6am

(green) take a cold shower

(green) meditate

(red) smoke a joint

(red) waste an hour on Netflix

(green) go to school

(red) hangout with X toxic friend and drink beer

I hope you see what I meant with the coach analogy now. You will get a lot of feedback on what you do each day. When I first started doing this I was shocked by how much red activities I had and  made it a mission to get more green activities in there. It was slow progress but steadily it got better.

If you don't like the left part of the journaling (which is how most people recommend it), I would advice you to try the right page. If you're gonna do one, it should be the right page. See it as a free life coach.

# SLEEP SCHEDULE

When I was at rock bottom my schedule was the furthest away from perfect that it could possibly be. One of the first things I changed that lasted was my sleeping schedule. I was done waking when it's almost dark already and still being tired. Also I noticed that everything I did in the late evening wasn't productive (or even counterproductive) like watching screens and doing drugs

There are good reasons to wake up early (5-6-7 AM). The best sleep you can get is the sleep between 10 and 12. If you're still awake at 00:00 you will produce cortisol and adrenaline to keep you awake. This isn't healthy. Good sleep improves cognitive function, vitality and motivation by a lot. There are many more benefits to a good sleeping schedule, and I think it's well known that it's a lot better. However most people think it's hard to change their schedule.

It's not. This is how you do it;

\- Set your alarm at your goal wake up time (EG 6 am)

\- When it goes, get out of bed, immediately eat breakfast

\- Don't sleep the rest of the day

\- Make sure you stop all screens by 9:30 and are in bed before 10:00

\- Set the alarm again, you will most likely wake up before it goes.

It's as easy as this, now all you have to do is to stick with it. Start enjoying the vast amount if time you have available in the morning.

This post has gotten a lot longer than I anticipated. I really appreciate you reading it all the way through. If you have any questions feel free to post a comment or shoot me a message. I hope some of this has been helpful and I hope you will find success and happiness in life! Peace!

EDIT: This thing really blew up, it's the second highest post of all time in this sub right now! It means a lot to me that I touched so many people. I really appreciate all the comments, feedback and especially the positive vibes. I wish you all a good journey!

1mbhsfy,"For a long time, I was stuck in this cycle where I'd only be productive when I felt like it.

If I was in a bad mood, I'd tell myself to wait until tomorrow. When I was tired, I'd take a Netflix break. If I was stressed about something, I'd procrastinate until my headspace cleared up.

One day, my grandma was watching me complain about how I couldn't get anything done because I was ""too anxious"" about some work project.

She just looked at me and said, ""You know, during the war, we didn't have the luxury of waiting until we felt good to do what needed doing.""

Then she told me something I'll never forget:

**You need to seperate your actions from your feelings!**

She said most people think their feelings and their actions are married to each other. Happy means productive, sad means lazy, scared means stop. But that's just a story we tell ourselves.

""I didn't feel like rationing food or working on the farm. But I did it anyway. Not because I ignored my feelings, but because I did it WITH my feelings.""

When I complained that it's different now, that it's harder to stay disciplined with all the distractions and the flood of choices, she didn't argue with me.

She just nodded and said, ""You're probably right. But here's what I learned: don't lie to yourself by using your feelings as an excuse.

Don't say: ""I'm stressed, so I can't do it.""

She told me to change the narrative and tell myself: ""I'm stressed, that's fine, so I'll do it stressed.""

Now when I catch myself thinking ""I don't feel like working out,"" I flip it to ""I'm unmotivated, so I'll work out unmotivated. What's type of workout can I even do when I'm unmotivated?""

I figured that the problem with discipline is not the doing, it's the starting.

And my grandma's advice made the starting part extremely easy for me.

Today, I actually don't complain about distractions anymore. I use them to reverse-engineer my feelings and to turn them into a booster for action.

Every time I scroll social media mindlessly, I use a few tools (can recommend these [Reddit resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stopscrolling/wiki/index/)) to recognize. Then I reflect on my emotions and what type of action I'm avoiding (work, gym, chores, ...).

Then I close my eyes and hear my grandma. A minute later, my phone is gone.

Absolute legend that lady, really hope I have her for some more years.

# THEORY:

(Long time lurker, but this sub is pretty positive so I feel like I can share)

I had a theory.

The theory was that we are surrounded by information. In the sea of information, if we could sort all the most useful information into one book, we could provide a manual of life changing advice & help into one brief guide.

But how do we organize what is most important?

What better way to advocate for something being useful than an upvote right?

So I decided to find all the top self-help reddit threads of all time and read through all the top posts of this year. Then, I combined all the most common advice into a cheat sheet, with the most common advice prioritized at the top.

My end goal is to one day provide a ""Basic Human Needs"" course, where I could hopefully pass along all the useful advice I've collected from the over 300+ self-help books I've read and (literally) thousands of articles & posts I've combed through over time and form a virtual big brother / virtual mentor created from the internet.

(I never had a father to teach me stuff. Thanks to you all, I actually feel prepared for life.)

\-

# METHOD:

I first went to [http://redditmetrics.com/top](http://redditmetrics.com/top) and combed through the top 800 subreddits that had anything to do with self-help. These include getdisciplined, lifehacks, personalfinance, startup, and lots more.

I then opened up each subreddit, where I sorted by the top posts over the past year, and began to comb through each subreddit for common themes. Initial phases were rather difficult, because I had to type up anything that sounded like it would come up again.

After documenting all the themes, I then grabbed a new document and put together a clean list of all the things that began to repeat.

Anywhere that you see a x2, x3, etc. That is the number of times a concept is repeated almost verbatim in a post. Otherwise, it is ranked by how often the concept was loosely repeated.

I am fully aware that this isn't as scientific as I'd like this to be. I plan to do this again for All-Time, attach the spreadsheet of the data analysis, a list of subreddits analyzed and the posts within. I did not have enough time to do this over the weekend I could dedicate to this project.

**WARNING:** This is a prototype and it's ugly. Also, none of this is my opinion - just others.

# RESULTS:

## Success:

1. Optimism makes people perform better. Most importantly, the optimism that literally anything can be defeated with enough effort. Every obstacle is *merely* a challenge, not a threat. x 8
2. Habits are what form and deform your life. Humans are short-sighted. Build a ritual that will, much like compound interest, build an amazing life. x6  
Working out twice a day for a week won’t do much. But a year could make for a transformation. Failure is not one dramatic fall, but a series of small failures, compounded over a longer period. X 5
3. Scale slowly. An overnight success still had 1 step up goals every hour. A billion dollar company once only had a goal of a million dollars. Set numerous small, achievable, bite sized goals - as opposed to a few, huge chunky goals. X 4
4. Authenticity is king. People enjoy authentic people, respect authentic people and welcome authentic people. x 4
5. Common sense beats all rules, stipulations and otherwise. You likely know most of what you learn, it’s simply being reorganized to fit your mind better. When it’s time to take action, trust that you know what you’re doing and focus solely on moving. x 3
6. Success comes from trying something, failing and modifying the action - Thousands of times. No amount of preparation (beyond the basic) can prepare you for the first day with sharks. ACTION + MODIFICATION = RESULTS x 3
7. Show small amounts of gratitude every day. Make it apart of your ritual. The gratitude forces you to focus on the things you are happy about. Small gratitude is low commitment and high reward. X 2
8. Establish 3 to 20 second barriers between bad habits. Take batteries out the remote. Put junk food in trunk of car. It won’t stop you completely. But it will decrease significantly. Make positive habits easier. Pack a healthy lunch. X 2
9. A huge part of succeeding at something is simply showing up. Even if that means you just walked in the door and back out. If you show up, the math says you’ll succeed, eventually. X 3
10. Go 150% + beyond what you are expected to do. This is a 100% way to gain immediate traction. Applied with consistency can skyrocket results. x 2
11. Practice task isolation. The only thing that matters in that moment is the task at hand. Work on that task only until you are ready to stop. Nothing else matters until. X 2
12. Constantly be evaluating yourself. Every year, every month, week, day, hour. - Do this 100% objectively and healthily. The more you look at yourself objectively and decide what you’re doing right and wrong, the better feedback you can use to improve. X 2
13. If you are always the smartest person in the room, you’re probably in a room full of idiots or you’re lying to yourself.
14. Double down on your strengths. Neutralize your weaknesses. Make them just capable enough to swim still water.
15. Adaptation is the key to survival. You cannot run over a jungle, but with the right small, frequent adjustments, you can run through a jungle.
16. Discipline is not just following a plan when you need a plan, but following the plan when you’ve succeeded. Make a plan and follow it, regardless of your emotions.
17. When you first wake up, try breathing faster and faster until hyperventilation. It makes your body kick into awake mode quickly.
18. Try fasting from a bad habit completely. Replace it with something less bad. Over time, you can replace a lot of small bad habits with less bad habits and get big change.
19. Organization, habits and the process of planning is actually all simply tools to clear space in your brain. You cannot use a car efficiently if it is jammed to the ceiling with clothes and furniture that belong in your house. And the furniture and clothes can’t be used correctly either.
20. Take stock in the understanding that 90% of successful people are doing a lot of hustle underneath the glam and money. They wake up early, they skip parties and they work - A LOT.
21. Automate literally every task you do not enjoy. It will make your life focus on the things you do enjoy.
22. Most habits can be changed by finding the belief rooted to it and finding all the evidence you can to break it. - “The gym is a chore.” \*Watch documentaries about people who love the gym\* ""I love sugary foods"" \*Watch documentaries about sugar causing disease\* - You are what you subscribe to.
23. Tell no one your goals. Talking gives you a rush of endorphins and dopamine. You “dope yourself out” on talking and never get anywhere.
24. No amount of regret can bring back the dead. Love immensely and give your friends and family what they deserve as soon as possible and as often as possible.
25. Chain together successful tasks and create the illustration of commitment, thus reducing your likelihood to miss out. - Crossing off days on a calendar chains a habit and thus reduces the chance to break it.
26. Stage every commitment so you only give what you get back, and scale it slowly. Put in 1 cent, if it gives back 1 cent, then put in 5 cents. If it gives back 5 cents, continue. Never Give 100% to an idea you haven’t tested at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% etc.
27. Never show your cards first in a negotiation. The offer they have in mind may be much higher than you’re thinking.
28. In a dispute, ask for proof of everything. Make the process draining for the other party if you’re in the right and they are forcing you to wade through mud.

## Finance:

1. Every successful person saves money. EVERY. SUCCESSFUL. PERSON. SAVES. MONEY. Save, at the very least, 10%
2. Every successful person invests. Invest in a bank, invest in real estate, invest in yourself. No matter how you invest, it’s the only way to grow. Spend your money on things that grow. - This includes your health.
3. Do not skip on insurance. The peace of mind that disaster will not ruin you is worth the duty paid.
4. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.

## Social:

1. Listen to people. Ask open-ended questions to get someone to talk. Why, what and how questions. To enhance listening, look for a one sentence life lesson to take from every story / interaction. x 4
2. You are upset because no one calls you to do things. So is the person who didn’t call you. Initiate activity. This is a solid way to be invited to more things, meet new people and have fun. X 2  

   1. Group activities are always more comfortable.
   2. Have a specific plan in place of who, what, when, where & why.
   3. Sometimes the event will fall apart. This is common. Do it anyways. It’s worth it.
   4. Social people invite others out when they feel lonely. Antisocial people wait for a phone call. Antisocial people have a higher probability of being lonely.
3. Traveling & expanding your social circle makes you more confident in who you are.
4. Be 10% more excited than the person you are talking to in positive conversations.
5. You have value to add to every interaction. Whether it’s with a CEO or a janitor. No matter your past - If you’ve burned many bridges, at least you had bridges to burn.
6. If 10 people in a row reject you as a friend, that’s only .000000015 percent of the world’s population. You’ve got a whole lot more to choose from.
7. Small talk is the door to deep friendship. You must make small talk first. You first said “Hi” to your significant other, you first had an interview at a company. People need to know you won’t stab them before they want to hang out.
8. Letting go of the thought that people have to like you is the best decision you will ever make. People would have liked or disliked you regardless of how lightly you tread.
9. Talk to people’s emotions. A metalhead and a classical music lover can connect on how emotional they get during a raw, deep piece.

## Health:

1. Get 6-8 hours of sleep. It can cause huge detriments to your wellbeing to get less. X 3
2. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. X 2
3. Sleep is one of the more important aspects of health, right beside nutrition and exercise. Master these three and you are doing well.
4. Optimum sleep temperature is 61-64 degrees F. Optimal sleep warm up is 1 hour before bed to begin process attempting sleep. - No screens, no exercise, no stress.
5. Meditation provides a range of health benefits.
6. Exposure to nature prevented hay fever and other illnesses in cavemen.
7. Stem cells regrow the body.
8. Alcohol consumption linked to many diseases we didn’t think - such as Alzheimer's, Dementia, Cancer, etc. Alcohol companies are funding research to make alcohol okay or “healthy”. X 2
9. Not exercising is worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease.
10. Tobacco use linked to a quarter of a billion life-years lost vs. illegal drugs accounting for only tens of millions.
11. Education linked to better health than income. Intelligent people make smarter health decisions that prevent the need for reactive, potentially too-late healthcare.
12. Dropping smartphones from evening activity led to 93.6% of participants opting to keep their phones off at night. - Increased happiness, focus & wellbeing.
13. Dark chocolate is a superfood. Good for health and mind.

## Business:

1. WHO matters most, then WHY, then HOW, then WHAT, then WHEN. Hire the right people with the right motives who follow a great plan and what you do and when you do it should work out on it’s own. x 2
2. Facebook, Uber, AirBnb, eBay - All got their start connecting two people together who could help each other. None have inventory, shipping centers, etc.
3. Buy low, sell high. Every business is in the business of buying something cheaper than they sell it. Simplify your business by asking what you’re buying for cheap, and selling for more.
4. Personal letters are the only way to get through a noisy world today. Find a way to personalize every communication you send.
5. The product will sell itself. Build a product that people will talk about.
6. Test EVERYTHING. We live in a hyper-feedback world. Run test after test and build on what works. Methodically test every single aspect of your business.
7. “Big Picture” thinkers don’t work well in a startup. You need detail oriented thinkers to calculate every move and thought.
8. Ideas are like treadmills. It can be a catalyst to something great, but will require you to execute methodically and frequently. A treadmill without work is worthless.
9. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.
10. The best marketing is word of mouth. Talk to the loudest birds and get noticed effortlessly.
11. Know your worth. Ask for that raise. It costs money to replace an employee, and it could be a significant amount.

Im not sure if I can post links here, but if someone wants it, I have a printable Google Doc of the cheat sheet. I read it once a week or so.

I also did this with most sold self-help books of all-time if anyone is interested.",r/getdisciplined,[Method] I summarized all the top posts of the top self-help subreddits of all time into a cheatsheet.,7161,
ic70lc,"It sounds simple, but when I realized it - it helped me a lot. I'll try to share it.

The root problem with many productivity issues is being constantly overstimulated.

People often tell ""I was doing nothing the entire day instead of working"" while the truth is that you were not doing anything. You were stimulating your brain all the time using social media or something else.

The message to your brain is simple then: I can be laying all day and still be stimulated. And THIS is why you feel the urge to lay in the bed. It's a cheap way of getting stimulation for your brain. Your brain hates doing nothing.

Try to sit somewhere for an hour or two and do nothing. Put your phone next to you and just look at it.

You will quickly notice that your brain starts to negotiate with your conditions of being stimulated.

At first, it'll just tell ""come on, let's just check Twitter"". Then, it'll start to lower its requirements and at some point, you can feel like on some sort of drugs. You'll want to sing some song, move your legs, whatever. This is the key.

When feeling the urge to procrastinate, I've started to try to put it in a bit different perspective.

Instead of fighting 'do it now' vs 'do it later with my brain, I've told myself 'Ok, Brain, we don't have to do it now. We can sit here the entire day and don't even start doing it. BUT we'll do NOTHING else.'

And this is what started to help me.

With time, I've realized it's hard to do NOTHING, when the brain is stubborn for a long while, as you might have to wash your dishes, etc. So this is fine, but just do something that is not stimulating you. (washing my dishes without music etc. is not stimulating for me).

What I've also noticed is how bad 'infotainment' can be for you. You lay in bed and check some 'nice websites'. You're learning a lot about maths, space, and productivity from youtube, etc. (you might think it's way better than social media).

4xwrut,"Learn to front-load your pain.

That's it. 

If you procrastinate, you're putting off more than your work. You're putting off the *pain.* Right? 

But doesn't it always catch up to you? 

What you have to do is front-load all those yucky crappy feelings. Go ahead and feel it now so you don't have to feel it later. And guess what? If you put it off, it gets amplified. Right now you're dreading doing your homework or writing an article or w/e, but what if you don't do it? And worse, what if you put that stuff off consistently? 

That thing you feel crappy about? That thing you're dreading? That is *exactly* the thing you need to do in order to improve your life. 

It's a sign post. 

Instead of dreading it, go ahead and embrace it. Embrace the yucky feeling and all. If you can do this for three weeks consistently, you will change your life forever. 

If you embrace all that yucky stuff with gusto, your brain will take notice. Your brain is not static. it changes depending on what you focus on. The circuitry in your brain literally changes over time. 

Finally, think of your actions as alchemy. You are taking time and adding energy to it to create a result. If you take action haphazardly, you will have a meh kind of life. 

You *know* you're going to end up  feeling like shit if you procrastinate anyway, so go ahead and do the thing you're afraid to do. If you're going to feel bad either way, you might as well take the action that will improve your life.

1mrsmsh,"People hype discipline like it’s all about waking up at 5 AM, cold showers, grinding like a robot. Tbh, that’s not real discipline, that’s just cosplaying productivity for Instagram. Discipline is doing the stuff you promised yourself you’d do, even when you’re tired, bored, or straight up not in the mood. It’s studying when your brain says scroll, it’s cooking a simple meal instead of ordering junk, it’s closing the gap between what you said you’d do and what you actually do.

The brutal truth is, discipline is boring most of the time. It’s not hype, it’s not motivation, it’s the tiny choices stacked day after day that nobody claps for. That’s why people give up, because there’s no dopamine rush in doing the same thing consistently. But that’s where growth is, fr.

Discipline is not about perfection, it’s about trust. Every time you keep a promise to yourself, you build self-respect. Every time you break it, you train yourself to not believe your own words. And once you stop trusting yourself, it’s game over. That’s why the real flex isn’t a 5 AM routine, it’s being able to say “I’ll do it” and then actually doing it, no excuses.

If you slip up, don’t spiral. The real secret is never missing twice. You miss one workout, fine, but don’t miss the next. You procrastinate one day, fine, but don’t let it turn into a week. Discipline is not about being perfect every single time, it’s about refusing to let your bad days outweigh your good ones.

a1sa3p,"**1. Breakfast IS NOT the most important meal of the day.**

I trained for the marathon in the mornings and ran for several hours at a time - *without having breakfast*. Fat is our body’s ‘natural’ and preferred source of energy - *not carbs or proteins* \- and this was what ‘fueled’ me on most of my runs.

**2. Life is quite simple.**

Whether it’s running a marathon or going for a 10 minute run, it doesn’t matter. It comes down to the same thing... putting one foot in front of the other.

Showing up. Getting Started. Doing the work.

It’s that simple.

This concept applies to ANYTHING you want to accomplish in life. Break down your goals into the smallest steps possible and just keep taking those steps until you get to where you want go.

**3. Consistency.**

As long as you keep showing up and taking action, you will get better.

It’s a no brainer.

If you want to be a better writer, artist, musician, or athlete, show up - be consistent.

>***""We are what we repeatedly do.""***  
>  
>\-Aristotle

**4. Life is ALL a mental game.**

Your body and feet might be aching with pain as they bitch at you screaming at the top of their lungs telling you to stop and slow down, but if your mind refuses to listen, your body will continue to obey.

>***""When you think you're done, you're only at 40% of your body's capability.""***  
>  
>\-David Goggins, Retired Navy Seal

**5. You only have as much energy as you use.**

The most productive period in my life was when I was training for the marathon. It could have been a coincidence but I highly doubt it reflecting back.

When you can run for 3+ hours in one sitting, I think that makes it much easier to work 3 hours straight as well.

**6. People who love eating really should run (or do any other cardio intensive sport).**

As I was training for my marathon I lived in Chiang Mai, Thailand for a month and I regularly visited the same restaurant to have a feast, especially after my longer runs.

I'd go there and order 3 main meals along with a smoothie.

After several visits, one of the waitresses said I shouldn’t keep eating like this because I would get fat.

Jokes on her, when I left Thailand, I hadn’t even gained a pound. My weight barely fluctuated because when you run a few hours each day… **You can eat A LOT.**

[https://imgur.com/a/axXMk](https://imgur.com/a/axXMk)

**7. Making a** ***real*** **commitment is POWERFUL.**

I’d always wanted to run a marathon but was never into running. I decided to stop saying I would *one day* run a marathon and just go fucking do it.

I Googled for the next local marathon event and signed up for it. On that day, I made a *real* commitment. I was going to finish that marathon no matter what. And that’s seriously all it took.

I found a training program, showed up and followed it to a tee because I was *committed*.

There was no backing out. In my mind I literally could not fathom any other alternative except seeing myself cross that finish line.

**8.Challenging yourself is important.**

I had so much confidence in the deep seated belief that I *would* finish the marathon no matter what… So I had to make the goal more challenging.

When something is *seemingly* easy, I’m prone to slack off, so I set a goal of finishing the marathon in under 4 hours.

It was a pseudo-goal to help me reach my true goal of finishing the marathon.

I missed the 4 hour mark by 1 minute and 46 seconds but in the end I still achieved my real goal!

>***“A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.”***  
>  
>\-Bruce Lee

**9. Prepare ahead of time and prepare for the worst.**

In preparing for my marathon, I signed up for a half marathon and didn’t realize the trains wouldn't be running that early in the morning until the day of the half marathon.

I just assumed they'd be running because it was a big event. Well, I guess I made an ass out of myself…

I had to Tokyo Drift all the way to the city in my car from the train station, find parking, and sign in when everyone had already left the starting line.

In hindsight, I should have prepared and double-checked on the logistics of getting to the event much, much earlier - not just the night before.

***On top of this mishap…***

On the day of the marathon, the GPS on my phone wouldn’t connect and I had no way to track how fast I was running or how many miles I had run.

I did not expect this would be a problem at all but in hindsight I should have prepared for a ‘worst’ case scenario.

**10. Life is all about the process and the journey.**

Not the destination.

Throughout much of my training I kept questioning myself as to why I was doing all of this running for a ‘stupid’ marathon and all because I had made a ‘stupid’ commitment.

As a result, my training sessions leading up to the marathon were much more dreadful than they needed to be.

I could have had ***a lot more*** fun and enjoyed myself a lot more throughout the whole process if I had chosen instead to focus on the *right* things.

**11. The Rain is AWESOME.**

Most of us have been brainwashed into thinking that cold, rainy, and stormy weather is ‘bad’ weather but in reality, *that’s just, like, your opinion, man*.

Running in what some would consider the worst weather conditions to run in is something I'll never forget, I got a ton of joy and bliss out of those stormy runs.

**12. Being badass is subjective.**

I woke up and run at 5AM on weekdays to fit in my runs before heading off for work. Doing this made me feel like an absolute bad ass - *especially in the middle of winter*.

With everything else I managed to do in the mornings before work, I’d say I accomplished more than what most people did in a whole day, and all before they even got out of bed.

I was cruising in 6th gear when they hadn’t even fired up their engines.

**That to me was pretty bad ass.**

To others, that might seem like hell.

n65ttc,"Don’t tell anyone you’re starting shit. You get a fake rush of endorphins, you get the reward of acknowledgement that what you’re stating you’re gonna do is “so great” and “good for you!”  It’s fake ass praise and then you feel shame when you don’t follow through. Keep that shit close to your chest. Celebrate your success privately. Allow yourself to cherish small daily wins and the success or change you experience will show soon enough. At the end of the day we’re getting better for ourselves or those we love, and the expression that we’re changing or starting something without doing it is ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT to ourselves and those we love if we don’t follow through. If you privately fail, then privately pick your shit up, and keep chugging along. Never stop starting over. Each day is a battle.

Edit: SOMETIMES telling a select few can help. Sometimes external motivators in the forms of other people are nice. Still risky in my book. Imagine this: you read a bunch of books, start a side hustle and lose 20 pounds without telling anyone. If it seems less significant than doing the same with public knowledge, your motivations are likely off. Do it for yourself and those you love.

1kjwdte,"You're probably thinking this was the result of insane willpower, but I actually found it just as difficult as quitting any one of those things in isolation.

I'm going to split this into three parts: the effects I felt, my recommendations/ tips for anyone else trying it, and the context. The context is last because it's probably the least interesting but it's there to explain how long I had been trying to quit each vice for - it ranges from 1 year to 10 years.

Disclaimers: 
a) I used to read posts like this on the sub and think it was an exaggeration. But I genuinely feel this way - my mind was just so undisciplined that I had no idea what this could feel like.

b) I'm not here to say any one of these ""vices"" is bad. I just identified that I had an all or nothing mindset towards them, and I didn't like the impact it had on my life. 

1 | The effects

I feel unbelievably energetic, mentally clear, confident, witty, kind, and full of love for other people. I want to share the energy I now feel with friends and family and it feels amazing to make them happy. Going out of my way to plan things or get thoughtful gifts for people, offering to help people move houses with no payment. I have shed a thick layer of selfishness I had most of my life. Everybody is saying that something in me has changed hugely. 

I can plan better, I can tolerate boredom way better. Instead of reaching for my phone, I get a tea, go for a walk, tend to my plants, read a book. Books are suddenly insanely interesting. I can't put them down, just like when I was a kid. My hobbies are a million times more interesting. 

I get much more done at work, and I really care about my work. I can sit and focus literally all day at work because it's super interesting again. I can sit and do my hobbies like tech projects or language learning until I get hungry, thirsty, or my brain aches. 

This next part is a little bit self-indulgent, but anyway... I've been on successful dates with much more confident, smart, attractive people, because that's who I feel reflected in myself now. I feel very different on these dates - previously the brain fog or anxiety from my lifestyle would have prevented me from having lucid, flowing conversations for so long. But I can talk endlessly now and I think they can see that I genuinely like myself as well - which I didn't always feel before. 

I have a better bulwark against the things I was addicted to. Breaking multiple addictions at the same time has meant that any time I need to use more willpower to resist one of them, the lack of presence of the others makes it easier to resist. 

Finally, all those vices are just boring to me now. Scrolling is so uninteresting compared to a good novel or diving deep in a project. 

----------

2 | Recommendations

Quitting everything at once means you don't need to play whack a mole with your multiple vices when you quit one. I found I could quit something for a bit, but then noticed I'd replaced scrolling with sugar, then manage sugar and go to something else. 

My mindset was easily the biggest enemy before this. You need to be really, really kind and patient with yourself while you try to rewire your brain. Believe you can do it, even when your brain makes logical arguments you can't. I'm not religious but it is a form of faith - faith in yourself despite your track record. 

What also worked for me personally was the mentality that I only need to make it through today. I read something that said quitting any of these things for the rest of your life feels impossible - but making it til tonight? Easy. Besides that, I also gameified my progress using an LLM. This worked for as training wheels and now I don't need it. The former bit of advice is a constant mantra, however. 

But really, I don't think it's this specific advice that did it. I think that every person out there has one or more bits of advice that are gonna work for them personally. You need to try as much as you can to see what works for you. 

----------

3 | Context

For context, this is where I stood on everything before attempting it.

Reddit/ YouTube/ instagram, ie ""scrolling"": many attempts over the last say 6 years to cut down, some successful for about a month, but often replacing one with another. At its worst, I would be on YouTube in the shower and while brushing teeth. 

Added sugar: I've replaced this a bit with varied fruit. Attempted over the last 2 years, successful for about a month. 

Processed food: attempted for about 1 year after it became my replacement to quitting added sugar. 

Nsfw content: attempted for about 10 years. As mentioned at the start, I'm not here to recommend quitting if it's not an issue for you. But it was definitely the biggest issue for me.

Alcohol: I can resist alcohol pretty easily, and leading up to this I'd spent many months sober at a time. But when I did drink, I could easily drink way too much (if others were also binge drinking). I was halfway to sobriety, so I just decided to fully quit. This one was the easiest, but the health impacts of quitting even the occasional session has been great.

**I am writing this post to share the lessons I've learned. Including practical tips on how to change your life in your 20s.**

I'll be dividing things into 3 sections:

1. My story of transformation (in brief)
2. What NOT to do if you want to improve your life (things to avoid)
3. What to DO to change your life

**If you prefer video format, check out the first post in my profile.**

## Section 1: My Story (In Brief)

**My life dramatically changed from my mid to late 20s. In my mid-20s I:**

* Was socially awkward
* Rarely exercised
* Ate unhealthy foods
* Had no idea what I wanted to do in my career
* Played games and binge-watched shows all-day
* And had never been in a long-term relationship

**By my late 20s, I:**

* Was much more confident in social situations
* Exercised regularly
* Ate healthier
* Enjoyed my career
* Only played games or watched shows occasionally
* And by the time I turned 30, I was married to an amazing woman

**And you know what’s really awesome: 90% of my transformation took place in just a year or so!**

Once I applied the tips I am about to mention, change happened fairly quickly.

## Section 2: How to Change Your Life in Your 20s – What NOT to Do

Here are 5 tips for what to avoid doing, if you want your 20s to go in a positive direction.

## Tip Number 1: Don’t Hold on to Your Old Identity

In order to truly change, you need to let go of your Past Self.

**Do you have to let go of everything? Of course not. But you do want to shed the notion that you ARE fundamentally a certain way.**

For example:

* I am an awkward person.
* I am an undisciplined person.
* Or I am an out-of-shape person.

**Once you let go of your old identity, it is going to be easier to start forming new identities.**

Such as:

* I am a confident person.
* I am a disciplined person.
* Or I am a healthy person.

**Of course, you are going to have to couple this mindset shift with making actions that match. Which several of my other tips will touch on.**

But letting go of the past is an essential starting point.

## Tip Number 2: Don’t Compare Your Life to Other People’s Lives

When I was in my early to mid-20s, there was one thing I could always count on making me feel bad:

**Comparing where I was in life to where other people at a similar life stage were.**

Thoughts would enter my head like:

* **Why haven’t I found as much happiness in relationships?** A lot of people I know have had successful relationships by now.
* **I still have no idea what I want to do with my career.** But I just read about a billionaire CEO who is only 25 years old. And now I feel worse about myself.
* **How come some people I know are so confident in social situations, yet I am more awkward?** I wish my social skills were as good as theirs.

And you know where these kinds of thoughts got me? Absolutely nowhere.

**Once I finally stopped comparing myself to others, it became easier to focus on the things I could control.**

That is, the decisions I could make with my own life.

## Tip Number 3: Don’t Engage in Behaviors That Are Preventing You From Changing Your Life

**For a long time, I wanted desperately to change, but my bad habits kept getting in the way.**

Things like:

* Playing excessive amounts of video games.
* Binge-watching shows and podcasts.
* And eating too much junk food.

**Depending on what your bad habits are, it might be tough to change them.**

But know that you need to work towards removing or limiting those behaviors, in order to truly change your ways.

## Tip Number 4: Avoid People Who Are Holding You Back

Do you have friends or other people in your life who are making it harder to change?

Such as:

* **Bad Influencers:** People who tempt you to engage in behaviors you are trying to cut back on.
* **Change Resisters:** People who don’t like the idea of change and get upset when they see you changing.
* **Or Complainers:** People who are constantly complaining about where they are at in life. And whose way of thinking rubs off on you. Which causes you to complain more too.

If you have any people like this in your life, you have to either:

* **(A)** Distance them from your life. If that’s an option.
* **Or (B)** Establish clear boundaries with them, so they don’t prevent you from growing.

## Tip Number 5: When Trying to Change Your Life in Your 20s, Don’t Be Too Hard on Yourself

**On your journey to improve your life, things are going to happen.**

You are going to:

* Make mistakes.
* Miss opportunities.
* And fail to do all the things you know you should be doing.

And that’s okay. It’s perfectly natural and it’s going to happen.

**Remember, you aren’t going for perfection. You are just going for improvement.**

And that’s much more attainable.

## Section 3: How to Change Your Life in Your 20s – What to DO

Now that I’ve covered what NOT to do, it’s time to shift to what you should do.

Here are 9 tips for how to change your life in your 20s, that helped me turn things around.

## Tip Number 1: Change Your Life 1 Small Step at a Time

Change rarely comes from giant leaps. Instead, it comes through small decisions made day-after-day.

**I used to have an all-or-nothing mentality. And that resulted in me getting stuck in a vicious cycle:**

* First, I would work extremely hard towards changing my life for a few days or weeks.
* Then, I would burn out and not do anything for a long period.
* After doing nothing for a while, I would feel the need to make a change again. And would repeat the cycle.

**I finally got out of that cycle when I started focusing on making small changes.**

Changes that were small enough that I could keep up with them in the long-term.

Here’s how to do that:

* **Prioritize your goals:** You can’t do it all at once. Often it helps to just focus on 1 new change at a time.
* **When starting a new habit, go as tiny as possible:** For example, if you want to start meditating, don’t try to do 30 minutes a day. Instead, start with something smaller. Like 1 minute. Wait until you’ve formed a strong habit before you start making things more challenging.
* **Have specific, tangible goals:** You are much more likely to follow through with a small, specific goal, than a broad, vague plan. For example, you are not that likely to commit to something general, like “I want to learn programming.” But you are much more likely to commit to something specific, like “I am going to watch this introduction to JavaScript tutorial tomorrow morning.”

**If you start small, it will ADD UP to great things.**

## Tip Number 2: Get Organized!

If you want to change, one of the first places to start is organizing your life.

**Organization makes it easier for you to follow through with your goals. Because the more structured your life is, the more control you have over it.**

Here are some ways to get more organized:

* **Keep a to-do list:** When you write down your plans, you are much more likely to follow through with them.
* **Have a regular schedule:** Wake up and go to bed at similar times each day. And consider having regular morning and night routines you follow.
* **Clean your place:** It doesn’t have to be completely pristine, but it helps to establish good cleaning habits. A cleaner environment can put you in a better mindset to accomplish things.

## Tip Number 3: Take Care of Your Body

**One of the most helpful ways to change your life in your 20s is to prioritize your physical health.**

That means:

* Exercise
* Eat healthier
* Maintain good personal hygiene
* Get sufficient sleep
* And drink enough water

**Once I started exercising and eating healthier, everything else in my life started to fall into place.**

## Tip Number 4: Spend Time on Internal Growth

**In addition to taking care of your physical health, it is also important to focus on your mental health and emotional well-being.**

Here are a few things that can help:

* Meditation
* Journaling
* Informally reflecting on your life and ways of thinking
* And of course, therapy

## Tip Number 5: Improve Your Social Skills

**I used to be incredibly awkward in social situations.**

My awkwardness was particularly severe during high school and in college. But continued to an extent through my mid-20s.

**It wasn’t until I started consciously working on developing my social abilities, that my awkwardness started to diminish.**

Here are some keys to improving your social skills:

* **Go outside of your comfort zone:** In my mid-20s, I made a conscious effort to try to be more social than I had been and to meet new people. And as a result, I made some great connections.
* **Open Up:** I used to be more closed off. Unless I was around my close friends, I tended to shut down. For a long time, that held me back, because people are attracted to genuineness. Once I started opening up more, it helped me develop closer relationships.
* **Listen:** I used to be a horrible listener. Becoming a better listener has led to much deeper and better conversations, both personally and professionally. And has also helped me understand people better.

## Tip Number 6: Change Your Life in Your 20s by Helping Others

**Being there for other people can help you find a sense of meaning in your own life.**

Here are some ways to do that:

* Volunteer
* Be kind to random people you meet
* Or help people close to you

**For me, a big part of my sense of purpose is helping my wife through her struggles with mental illness.**

Being there to support her and help her through tough times has given me a reason to get up every morning.

## Tip Number 7: Try New Things (Even If You Aren’t 100% Sure About Them)

One thing that demoralized me a lot in my 20s, was the pressure I felt to know what I wanted to do in life.

**But here’s the secret: You don’t need to have all the answers. Sometimes, you just have to give things a shot. And see what works.**

Adopting this mindset led me to many new and rewarding experiences.

For instance, I:

* **Started going after different jobs:** Even if I didn’t know what I wanted to do in my career.
* **Experimented with exercise programs:** Even if I wasn’t sure if they had the “perfect routine.”
* **And had conversations with new people:** Even if I didn’t know if they would result in longer term connections.

Trying new things doesn’t always work out. But if you keep experimenting, you might discover some pretty incredible opportunities.

## Tip Number 8: Form Habits Instead of Relying on Motivation

Everything else I’ve mentioned is only going to work if you establish habits.

**Habits are behaviors that are so ingrained into your routine that you do them without having to be:**

* Motivated
* Energized
* Or inspired

You can incorporate habits into nearly any area of your life. For example:

* **If you want to improve your social skills,** you could start by forming a habit of initiating a conversation with a stranger once a week.
* **If you want to get a job,** you could start a habit of sending in 1 application every Monday.
* **Or if you want to clean a messy room in your apartment,** you could make a habit of doing 5 minutes of cleaning once a week. I am actually currently in the process of this one.

Habits are incredibly powerful and are capable of completely changing your life.

## Tip Number 9: Love and Accept Yourself

If you want to improve your life in your 20s, a great thing to focus on is learning to accept and love yourself.

**Yes, you want to improve. But that doesn’t mean you can’t love yourself until you’ve made it to the finish line. A finish line that may not even exist.**

I’m not saying loving yourself is going to be easy. Depending on where you are at, it may take time.

**But if you can begin to accept yourself, it will make the rest of your journey more enjoyable.**

## Final Words

When it comes to changing your life in your 20s, you don’t have to do any of this perfectly.

To stop blaming my past, my family, my situation, my genes. So today I got tired. Not tired like sleepy. Tired of my own bullshit. So I did something small. I got out of bed without snoozing. I drank water instead of grabbing my phone. I wrote down 3 things I wanted to do  and I did them. 

No dopamine rush. No claps. No applause. Just quiet progress. And for once, that was enough.

If you're reading this, stop waiting for a perfect version of yourself to arrive. You become that person by doing the boring, hard, unsexy stuff every day, especially when you don’t feel like it. Here’s what’s been helping me:

* Set 3 daily non-negotiables. Small ones. Like drink 1L of water, 20-minute walk, 10-minute journal. Hit them no matter what.
* Limit phone use in the morning. Your brain deserves peace, not chaos.
* When you slip (and you will), don’t throw away the day. Salvage what you can. 50% effort is still better than 0%.
* Stop chasing motivation. Build discipline through action.

You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to be consistent enough. Your future self is begging you not to give up. So don’t. ",r/getdisciplined,I wasted 4 years saying “tomorrow.” I finally broke the cycle here’s what actually worked.,3699,

Shower. Not a bath, a shower. Use water as hot or cold as you like. You don’t even need to wash. Just get in under the water and let it run over you for a while. Sit on the floor if you gotta.

Moisturize everything. Use whatever lotion you like. Unscented? Dollar store lotion? Fancy 48 hour lotion that makes you smell like a field of wildflowers? Use whatever you want, and use it all over your entire dermis. 

Put on clean, comfortable clothes. 

Put on your favorite underwear. Cute black lacy panties? Those ridiculous boxers you bought last christmas with candy cane hearts on the butt? Put them on.

Drink cold water. Use ice. If you want, add some mint or lemon for an extra boost. I always use lemon. 

Clean something. Doesn’t have to be anything big. Organize one drawer of a desk. Wash five dirty dishes. Do a load of laundry. Scrub the bathroom sink. 

Blast music. Listen to something upbeat and dancey and loud, something that’s got lots of energy. Sing to it, dance to it, even if you suck at both.

Make food. Don’t just grab a granola bar to munch. Take the time and make food. Even if it’s ramen. Add something special to it, like a soft boiled egg or some veggies. Prepare food, it tastes way better, and you’ll feel like you accomplished something. 

Make something. Write a short story or a poem, draw a picture, color a picture, fold origami, crochet or knit, sculpt something out of clay, anything artistic. Even if you don’t think you’re good at it. Create. 

Go outside. Take a walk. Sit in the grass. Look at the clouds. Smell flowers. Put your hands in the dirt and feel the soil against your skin.

Call someone. Call a loved one, a friend, a family member, call a chat service if you have no one else to call. Talk to a stranger on the street. Have a conversation and listen to someone’s voice. If you can’t bring yourself to call, text or email or whatever, just have some social interaction with another person. Even if you don’t say much, listen to them. It helps. 

Cuddle your pets if you have them/can cuddle them. Take pictures of them. Talk to them. Tell them how you feel, about your favorite movie, a new game coming out, anything.

z9q8hm,"# Part 1: The Problem

You’re stuck in a rut.

Apathy. Lethargy. Whole days wasted away on Reddit or YouTube. Procrastinating on basically everything. Coasting by in a mediocre existence.

You don’t want to keep living like this. You want to break out—to work hard and change your lifestyle, get fit, get a better job, start a business, pursue a creative dream—but for whatever reason, it's just impossible. You can never find the motivation to stick with anything.

You decide to dig; see if you can uncover *something* that will unlock your motivation. You find a motivational video that describes it perfectly.

>*You're drifting without clear purpose or aim. So you need establish your WHYs behind the many WHATs of your dreams.*

So you do all that.

And for the first time in a while, you feel a flicker of hope. You feel a little determination, a little eagerness to get to work.

So you sit down to make it happen—but then it hits you. That dreaded *ugh I just don't feel like it* feeling. You try to willpower through it, but not 5 minutes later, you're back on Reddit.

What gives?

….

Here’s the deal.

You're confusing inspiration with motivation. You're assuming they're essentially the same when, really, they're not.

The word motivation comes from the Latin word for “to move”. Interpret this, not as *the will to move*—that’s the domain of inspiration—but as *the capacity to move.*

All that “why” stuff is important, but it’s the stuff of inspiration. It’s the conscious will and intention to get your work done and achieve your goals. But you have plenty if that.

More is just not the solution.

**Motivation, on the other hand, is the subconscious** ***approval*** **to burn calories to do work.**

To use a car analogy, inspiration has you push on the gas pedal—and perhaps you’ll jam on it down extra hard if you have David Goggins blaring at you—but motivation… that’s the fuel injector.

That's the part way deep in the engine that you have no direct control over. It's the valve that ""decides"" to release fuel for combustion, which is what actually propels the heavy chunk of metal forwards.

Not saying it’s not important to get clear on your “whys”—a car won’t go fast or far if the pedal is barely tapped. I’m saying… your injector's been disabled. So you need to fix that first.

Here's a 5-step process to get there.

# Part 2: The Solution

# Step 1. First prevent what suppresses motivation

Us humans have serious survival needs. There's food, water, shelter... yet our psychological needs—love, intimacy, status, connection, adventure/novelty—are just as important.

Back in the day, the cost to satisfy those needs were egregiously high. It took boat loads of effort, time and risk to survive. We therefore evolved a motivation → reward neurological pathway, a system to subconsciously *compel* us to burn precious calories—yet with only the exact minimum amount required—in the pursuit of survival affirming rewards.

For the pleasure of food, you had to hunt.

For the pleasure of intimacy and sex, you had to court and risk being ostracized.

For the pleasure of status, you had to acquire resources.

There was always a tight balance between the reward and its energy and risk demand.

But that’s all changed.

With today’s vices, we can trick our brains into *perceiving* that these base needs are satisfied with virtually no work or risk.

For the pleasure of food, there's Door Dash.

For  the pleasure of intimacy and sex, there’s porn.

For the pleasure of status, there’s social media.

Today’s giant food, tech and entertainment industries have left no stone unturned. **Every single one of our base needs has its vice equivalent—a consumable product that can deliver psychological rewards via artificial or vicarious means.**

All that to say the “motivation” part of the motivation → reward pathway is no longer needed. Your subconscious—your body's fuel injector that *decides* whether or not to burn precious calories for survival—is now programmed to know it can ""survive"" exceptionally well with the flick of a thumb.

That’s why, after spending your morning on Reddit… then Pornhub, then Instagram, then YouTube… just the thought of opening up a work spreadsheet feels so grueling and unappealing.

It doesn't matter how adamantly your conscious mind is demanding the burning of calories. Doesn't matter if it's clamoring about the importance of long-term goals or about impending doom.

Your subconscious is utterly convinced that everything's fine—*c'mon man, just look at all the survival-affirming rewards we just felt!*—and that under no circumstances should scarce energy be burned.

The take-away is this: consuming vices does more than just waste time. They suppress motivation. They lead to resistance; to that drained, *ugh I just don’t feel like it* feeling.

Consume less crap. Practice digital minimalism. Delete and block stimulating sites and apps.

And when you need to, relax and unwind with less stimulating activities: reading, writing, creating, socializing, self-care.

# Step 2. Arrive at the proper mindset

I like to say that motivation is a cat.

It won’t come to you if you’re desperate for it; if you *need* it to come. You have to sit still for a short while, “pretend” like you don’t actually need it, only then will saunter over to you.

In other words, you need to find acceptance. You need to find acceptance of all that is now, in this tiny sliver of the present moment.

**Understand: The motivation to change things only happens once you come to accept the way things are.**

It's a colossal paradox.

But it makes perfect sense once you realize that the most productive people out there aren't motivated because they hate their lives and and are yearning for change. They aren't riddled with unsatisfied needs and wants. They already feel whole and complete as they are; yet they also have a fire lit under them to work, hustle and make themselves and the world better.

But coming to acceptance isn’t particularly fast or easy. If you go through with the first step above, you’re going to be left with a vacuum of your attention that will quickly fill with the thoughts, feelings and emotions—worry, anxiety, regret, stress, boredom—you’ve been impulsively using vices to distract and relieve.

So it’s going to feel like ""the now"" is anything but ok. It's going to feel like your life, as it is now, is just not good enough to accept as is.

Anticipate this.

There is no antidote. No prevention. The only way out is through. You’ll just have to sit tight for a while and be *mindful* of the experience.

Mindfulness is the practice of disassociating yourself from these thoughts, feelings and emotions. It involves observing dispassionately, them as if they were occurring outside you.

>*hmm, there it is, that feeling again. That dark cloud of depression and hopelessness. I feel it right there in my gut. It's not pleasant, but I’ll just sit and watch until it passes.*

From there, from that detached state, it'll be possible to come to a  gentle acceptance of all that is.

\*If you're finding this step particularly difficult or taxing, the support and guidance of a therapist can be key.

# Step 3. Start small with tiny amounts of willpower

You’re heard of the concept of tiny or atomic habits. It’s where you strip down and simplify a habit you want to take on until it becomes *almost* trivial to accomplish—one squat per day, when you want to be doing 50; one sentence written per day, when you want to be writing a 3 pages.

Starting small with habits is essential.

The trick is to just show up for the habit, without forcing yourself to start right away. Sit and wait. See if a drip of motivation occurs to you. If it doesn’t, see if you can use a little willpower to nudge you forward. If it’s really not happening—if you don’t have the spoons—just let go and come back tomorrow.

The beautiful thing is that actions *cause* more actions. It self perpetuates. Get started small and see your motivation to do a little more each time grow.

# Step 4. Engage in self-care and lifestyle actions

Motivation—in the free flowing amounts you want—ain’t free. It needs to be earned.

This happens by taking care.

First take care of yourself. Get good sleep. Cook and eat well. Practice good hygiene. Learn, create, explore. Take the time for recreation, relaxation, play.

Next, take care of others. Nothing nourishes the human spirit like doing good for others. It could be for your immediate circle, but also for your community, people of the internet, or the planet. Whatever floats your boat.

Positive action leads to positive feelings leads to the desire to take more positive action. The more you do good, the more you *want* to do good.

# Throughout. Be patient and self-compassionate

Self-compassion and patience is key in all this.

The state of your subconscious has nothing to do with who you are as a person. You wouldn’t look at a Ferrari with a disconnected fuel injector and conclude it’s a terribly, slow car.

So be ready to accept the fact that flossing even a single tooth might feel like an endeavor. Self-contempt and criticism in this are neither helpful nor deserved.

All this takes time. Motivation is cultivated just like a plant (last metaphor, I promise).

You need to gently place the seed in the right soil, give it a spec of nutrients and a splash of water—see the three steps above—but then it needs time to germinate, extend roots (which you won’t see for a while) and finally grow into a fruit bearing plant.

You can’t force it. You can’t make it grow faster. Too much sun and it burns, too much water and it drowns.

Let it be. Allow time to pass. Take the time to mindfully explore your emotions and inner sensations and detach from them.

Be compassionate with yourself when (and not if) you slip up. Remember: your subconscious is still programmed to believe it can survive best through vices. It'll take time, a bit of effort, and some good defenses (webblockers, environmental changes) to override and then rewire this programming.

# Past-focused mindset

""If I had only started playing guitar 2 years ago when my friend did, I would have been so good by now.""

""If I had only stuck to my diet 6 months back I'd be in such great shape today.""

""If I had only spent the last year being productive instead of spending most of my time distracting myself with games/TV, I would be so much more successful.""

# Future-focused mindset

**What if instead, you re-framed your thinking, from feeling regret and guilt about the past, to imagining the possibilities of the future?**

""Just imagine how great I could get at guitar if I play consistently for the next 2 years?""

""Just imagine how great shape I can be in if I eat healthy for the next 6 months?

""Just imagine how successful I will become if I spend the next year being more productive and spending less time distracting myself?

# Present-focused mindset

**What if in addition to re-framing your mindset from past to future-focused, you also focused more on what actionable steps you can take in the present?**

""What specific steps can I take today to improve my guitar skills?""

""What is a healthy meal I can have for dinner tonight to get on the path towards getting in better shape?""

""What is 1 thing I can do today that is productive?""

# Summing it up

I think both the future-focused and present-focused mindsets are helpful.

**Future-focused thinking** is helpful for determining your long-term goals/priorities, as well as for inspiration.

The **present-focused mindset** is helpful for forming more specific plans, and achieving moment-to-moment satisfaction.

**Past-focused thinking** has it's place too (e.g., assessing past performance can help inform future changes in your strategy).  But when you are focusing too much on the past in a negative way (regret, guilt, shame at what you did), that is less helpful.

kf9t7n,"I realized this after spending 3 months of such poor discipline that I was going to bed in the mornings and waking up at night. Gaming and binge watching YouTube, obsessing over social media. Eating only when I was hungry. Not taking care of my hygiene because I was always so unmotivated and tired. And just generally feeling like crap, _every.single.day._

It got to the point where nothing was enjoyable and I didn't enjoy anything I did no matter how 'exciting' the game or movie etc should've/would've been if I wasn't like this. Even simple things like looking forward to a nice delicious meal or a warm shower or a freshly made bed was irrelevant to my meaningless existence. I was living just to simply 'exist' and nothing more.

But, then I realized that to make my existence more meaningful. Say like how it felt when I was a kid, (everyone here remembers those times I'm sure. Those exhilarating moments of pure bliss and joy and laughter and happiness and living life because it was a joy to experience it. The bright outdoors, the warm sun, the singing birds, the beautiful colors of nature, the happiness of others i.e. At the beach or theme park etc.) That to experience that kind of 'joy' again, to make my life more meaningful like that again. Requires facing the risk of getting sunburnt, or falling over and skinning your knee, or getting picked on by other kids, or getting told off by your parents etc (all in context from the perspective of a child).

 And those are all significant risks and/or potentially painful experiences, but they don't take away from a child's enjoyment because the child doesn't think about those risks. It's the worrying parent that does. The parent who is fearing their child might hurt themselves, or that their child might get hurt, feel hurt, be hurt by others, i.e. other kids. And sometimes these worries that the worrying parent has for their children affects their child's enjoyment. It limits their freedom, it limits their experiences, it limits the amount of fun they can have.

So to piece it together. I'm limiting the amount of 'joy' I can experience by worrying about things I shouldn't be worried about. This 'avoidance' is like not going out for a run because you're afraid you might twist your ankle. Yet by staying at home and sitting around or sleeping. You risk many other health problems and issues far worse than a sprained ankle. And that's not all. The sprained ankle is only a 'potential risk' with a very low probability of it actually happening. The health issues that come from no exercise vary in significance greatly and there is a far greater chance of lasting adverse effects from lack of exercise than a sprained ankle. 

On top of that, emotionally speaking, it feels great to be able to rest your weary legs and tired feet after a nice long run. Whereas sitting down all day does not feel great. You don't find any pleasure in 'resting' after having not done anything. To sum it up. Pain and suffering is inevitable. But it's the choice that's yours. Do you want it now and consequently live out a happier, healthier life because you faced it. Or do you want it later and life a miserable and meaningless life, full of regret and sorrow. Because you're going to experience pain and suffering one way or another. It's the choice of facing and dealing with it head-on, or saving it for later. The choice is yours.",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] If you try and live your life avoiding pain and suffering by not 'doing things' that you know would be beneficial to you.

You’re not just going to wake up as a productive supersoldier.

You have to start implementing seemingly small changes today, and building on them every day or every week. 

Our bodies and minds don’t like dramatic change of any kind, so you need to take small steps in the right direction.

Get up 15 minutes earlier than usual, not 3 hours.

Have warm showers then turn them cold for the last quarter, so you don’t just end up avoiding showers or having extremely short ones because that’s just unhygienic. 

Try to workout one day per week more than you’re currently doing, not daily. 

Start surfing the internet a little less than usual instead of blocking all your favourite diversion sites.

Add some steamed vegetables to your dinner, drink a bit more water than usual - don’t just throw out your entire fridge and restock it with organic food. 

Read a few pages of a book instead of expecting to get through an entire chapter.

Have one difficult conversation you’ve been putting off and go from there - don’t just flip your persona overnight. 

Make eye contact and some conversation with someone you’re attracted to where it’s appropriate- don’t try to get rejected 10 times per day so you’re immune to it or whatever that literature suggests. 

Drop masturbation back to once or twice per week (or thereabouts) instead of doing some total abstinence, although only do it when you’re in the mood not procrasturbating. 

Acknowledge any progress no matter how small. Accept failures no matter how large. 

Expecting to flip your lifestyle upside down overnight because you just read “you can’t hurt me” or listened to a jocko willink podcast might work for a few hours, maybe even a few days, but the change will eventually seem too drastic and you’ll rebound back to your old habits.

This may seem slack and counterintuitive but it’s essentially learning how to self reward to create sustainable change. Recent Neuroscientific research also corroborates that this ability is instrumental in allowing an individual to achieve formidable long term goals. 

For too many years I believed that my ultra disciplined alter ego was right around the corner - so today was one last rodeo of dissolution before I pulled myself up by the bootstraps and got disciplined. 

Only later did I truly realise this was an excuse to avoid taking any action. 

So start now.

For years, I dealt with constant fatigue and a complete lack of drive to do anything beyond the absolute essentials.

Back when I was in school, I managed to graduate, but never reached the academic potential I knew I had. Later, at work, I could hold down a job, but I never really thrived. I always had intentions to eat better, exercise, and take care of myself, but despite the goals I set, I could never stick to anything long enough to see results. Over time, my health declined, and the cycle just kept repeating.

I tried to boost my productivity with systems like David Allen’s GTD and countless optimization techniques, but none of it stuck, I simply couldn’t follow through.

Eventually, I came across an episode of Huberman’s podcast where he talked about dopamine regulation. That episode changed everything. I had always assumed that my lack of motivation was due to ADHD or something similar, but for the first time, I realized it might actually be tied to how I was engaging with habits and dopamine, something I could work on and influence.

One thing became immediately obvious: like so many others, I was completely hooked on my phone. My day started and ended with scrolling. After listening to that podcast, I saw clearly how overstimulated I had become.

Breaking that addiction became a full-on mission for me. It wasn’t easy, but I eventually cut my screen time from over 7 hours a day to under an hour.

And honestly? That single change transformed my life.

I started sleeping better. My energy lasted through the day. I now work out consistently because I actually enjoy it. I began cooking for myself and eating healthy. I even left my job to start my own business.

Looking back, it was hands-down the most impactful decision I ever made.

I genuinely believe this is something almost everyone is grappling with today. Whenever someone tells me they’re struggling with focus, discipline, or just improving their life, the first thing I suggest is tackling phone addiction. It’s the keystone habit that makes room for all the other good habits.

Cutting back on screen time is hard, but here are a few things that helped me make a real difference:

Delay phone use in the morning. Try waiting at least an hour after waking up before you touch your phone. Your dopamine levels reset while you sleep, so mornings are when your self-control is strongest. Take advantage of that window.


Use a screen time tracker that works for you. App blockers didn’t do much for me. What helped was switching to an app, that makes reducing screen time a kind of game, rewarding you with dopamine for staying off your phone. You can even play with friends. But there are other good ones out there too,  the key is finding one that keeps you engaged.


Remove your most distracting apps from your phone. You don’t need to delete your accounts, just remove the apps so you can only access them from a computer. When you do that, you’re forced to use them more intentionally instead of scrolling mindlessly.

**Why Cold showers are amazing**

*  seriously, nothing wakes you up faster than freezing water. apparently, cold showers make your body release adrenaline, which is why you go from ""zombie mode"" to ""ready to fight a bear in like 10 seconds.

>*A study in Medical Hypotheses says cold showers release norepinephrine, which is this brain chemical that makes you more alert and less blah.*

* after a cold shower, my brain feels calm. It's not like magic or anything, but a study from 2007 says cold water can lower your stress hormone (cortisol). I feel it.
*  I don't know how it works, but doing something so uncomfortable first thing in the morning makes the rest of my day feel easier.
* if you can stand in the freezing water for 3 minutes, you can pretty much do anything.

  
**How to survive the freezing hell**

* trust me, don't jump strait into ice-cold water unless you wanna hate your life. start with 10-15 seconds at the end of a warm shower and slowly add more time every day.
* when the cold hits, your brain is gonna scream ""Get out!"" but just use this method called box breathing, (inhale for 4 secs, hold for 4, exhale for 4.) Trust me. It works.
* the more consistent you are, the less it sucks. i missed one day and felt like a slug again. don't miss a day.

  
**More research**

>*A 2008 study says cold showers make your brain release beta-endorphines, which are like feel-good chemicals that make you happy. it's like a natural antidepressant.*  


>*PLOS ONE did a study and found people who took cold showers got sick less often.*

>  
*Cold water also improves circulation and reduces inflammation, according to actual doctors. so yeah, it's good for your body too.*

  
**Read this part**

wake the fuck up and stop taking the easy way out. life isn't gonna hand you discipline on a silver platter, and cold showers are the ultimate test to prove you can handle discomfort. If you can't stand just 2 minutes of freezing water, how are you gonna handle real challenges? cold showers aren't just about waking up, they're about rewiring your brain to stop being weak and start doing hard stuff.

stop overthinking it, stop making excuses, and just do it. step into the freezing water, show yourself you're tougher than you think. two weeks of this, and you'll walk out feeling like a new person.

ijxtaa,"**TL;DR:** Switch to Robot Mode where you don't care about how well you perform in the task. Then work in a timeframe you feel comfortable with. Track and make your next day 1% better.

**Edit:**

People think that it's hard to switch to robot mode, or robot mode is not useful for tasks with high cognitive load tasks such as studying.  u/successufd has some good advice in his original [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ijaekv/needadvice_i_love_the_idea_of_planning_writing/g3d0svd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for how to switch into robot mode. It also seems like not everyone can get into a phase where they are unbothered by the outcome and their emotions. To me, robot mode is essentially a phase where you are doing the minimal shit within a timeframe because you have told yourself to, not because it helps your life better or etc. It's NOT a mode where you consciously envision your goal coming true, or where you think about the good things about the job. **Robot Mode is a mode where you say, ""I'm not going to do anything else other than this thing because I've instructed myself to do, and it's completely okay that I do a shitty job.""**

My take is that robot mode is very effective for tasks that are brain-demanding. Here's how I do things during the initial phase: for research, I spend half an hour typing nonsense; for researching graduate schools, I spend half an hour surfing a college website; for programming, I spend half a hour copying documentation. The most important thing are **iterations, which is why I include Tips 2 and 3.** You want many sessions improving a poorly done job, and getting from shitty to brilliant is usually faster than you thought.

I procrastinate a lot, and by tracking my work hours, I realize that I've only worked on things that matter for 4.5 hours every day. For the rest of the time, I spend it on Youtube, Facebook, and Reddit.

I recently saw a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ijaekv/needadvice_i_love_the_idea_of_planning_writing/g3d0svd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) talking about human mode and machine mode where the human mode is susceptible to emotions, which leads to procrastination. Those negative emotions associated with a task drive a person to procrastinate. **I realize that the source of negative emotions is that we care about how well we perform in our task, and our ego doesn't want us to perform poorly.**

If we know that we can do well in a task and we can complete it within an acceptable time frame (like in 15 minutes), we would not hesitate to do it. But when we cannot see ourselves confidently tackling the task, or when we see ourselves unable to complete it fast enough (such as cleaning the dishes in 5 minutes), we tend to procrastinate. Our primal brain prefers not doing a task to doing a task poorly.

It's more than ""Just do it."" - the instruction you give is ""Just do the task in XXX minutes (a time frame you are comfortable with; you cannot force yourself to overwork)."" A machine doesn't care about the feelings, the outcome, and the feedback for the task.
2. **Negotiate with yourself and understand that time-frame is non-linear**: A lot of people including me like to tyrannize ourselves by forcing ourselves to complete a task in an uncomfortable timeframe. And we call it self-discipline, and we feel bad when we cannot complete it in time. (Think about how you rush stuff right before the deadline.)  After a lot of journaling, I find that it's beneficial to understand planning fallacy: sometimes, it takes longer to complete the task; sometimes, it takes a shorter time (esp. if you are in the flow). So, find a time that you are comfortable with (maybe just 5 minutes) and switch to machine mode.
3. **Track your time and plan your next day such that it is 1% better than today**: Drastic changes don't work. You will fall back to bad habits. Here's a better alternative – first, track how you spend your time comfortably in a day, which is usually a combination of work (or errands) and play. Then, refer to this tracking when you schedule your next day - you don't want to deviate too much. For example, I work from 9am to 12pm, and I surf Facebook from 3pm to 6pm today. Tomorrow, I will work from 8:30am to 12pm, and I will surf Facebook from 4pm to 6pm.

1gx14g7,"# About me:

For over two decades, I lived a life completely lacking discipline. I was the textbook definition of a mess:

* I’d skip school for weeks or months at a time.
* I’d spend entire nights binge-watching garbage on the internet, ignoring responsibilities.
* My grades were abysmal, assignments were always overdue, and I had no focus or direction in life.
* Add to that an addiction to fast food and endless social media scrolling, and you get a clear picture of someone stuck in a downward spiral.

Fast forward to today, and I’m a completely different person.

* I’ve worked as a software engineer at Fortune 500 companies.
* My academic performance improved drastically.
* I consistently lift weights, read books, train in martial arts, and work on my business.

How did this transformation happen? It wasn’t overnight, and it wasn’t by simply “trying harder.”

Here’s what worked for me:

# 1. I Stopped Relying on Willpower

For years, I thought discipline was all about willpower. You just “decide” to do something, and then you do it—right? Wrong.

I learned that willpower is like a battery—it runs out. Sure, you can force yourself to wake up early, work out, or eat clean for a few days, but eventually, your reserves will deplete, and you’ll revert back to old habits.

Here’s an analogy that helped me understand this:

Imagine you’re thrown into a pit with 50 other people, all heavily armed with body armor, rifles, and night vision goggles. You, on the other hand, have nothing but a tiny knife. Your chances of surviving that fight are slim to none.

Relying solely on willpower is like being that person in the pit—it’s an uphill battle you’re almost destined to lose.

So, I stopped relying on raw willpower and started equipping myself with better tools.

# 2. I Built Systems

The most important shift I made was creating systems that removed the need for constant decision-making and made discipline automatic.

# System 1: A Routine

I started organizing my day into a routine. Every activity—working out, studying, eating, and even relaxing—had a specific time slot.

Why does this work?

1. **It removes decision fatigue:** Constantly debating whether to go to the gym, study, or scroll on your phone is mentally exhausting. With a routine, there’s no debate—you just follow the plan.
2. **It prepares your mind for what’s coming:** If you know you’re hitting the gym in 30 minutes, your brain starts to prepare for it. This makes transitioning into the activity much easier.

**Pro Tip:** Remove barriers to action. For example, if I know I need to study after dinner, I set out my books, clean my desk, and know exactly what I need to tackle beforehand. This eliminates excuses and makes starting much easier.

# System 2: A Rulebook

I also created a personal ""code of conduct""—rules I don’t break, no matter what. These are based on patterns I noticed in my life. For instance:

* **Rule: No phone for the first 4 hours of the day**. In the past, I’d start my day by checking notifications and scrolling through social media. It seemed harmless but would ruin my focus and fill my mind with chaotic energy. Now, I avoid my phone in the morning, and my days are far more productive and peaceful.

You can create your own rules based on your triggers. For example, if hanging out with a certain friend always leads to bad habits, consider limiting that interaction. Write down your rules, and stick to them like your life depends on it—because in some ways, it does.

# 3. I Switched from Instant to Delayed Gratification

In my undisciplined days, my life revolved around instant gratification:

* Hours of video games.
* Scrolling endlessly on Instagram.
* Eating fast food and snacking whenever I felt like it.

These activities gave me a quick dopamine hit, but they came at a cost. I felt unmotivated, unproductive, and unhappy. Worse, I craved more of these fleeting pleasures just to feel a baseline level of satisfaction, which created a vicious cycle.

The breakthrough came when I discovered the power of delayed gratification:

* The sense of accomplishment after a workout.
* The satisfaction of completing a productive work session.
* The happiness that comes from knowing I made progress toward my goals.

Unlike instant gratification, delayed gratification doesn’t leave you drained or craving more—it leaves you fulfilled. Over time, I found myself craving these long-lasting rewards instead of the quick dopamine hits.

# What I’ve Learned

Discipline isn’t about brute-forcing your way through life. It’s about creating an environment that supports your goals and adopting systems that make progress inevitable.

If you’re struggling with discipline, ask yourself:

* Are you relying too much on willpower?
* Do you have a routine or rules that guide your daily life?
* Are you chasing fleeting pleasures or long-term fulfillment?

rp90zx,"I just wanted to make this somewhat quick. I just turned 30 not too long ago, so I am a bit older than some of the people who frequent this subreddit. I'm at the stage of my life where I can see the effects of long-term discipline or long-term neglect on various life choices that I and others have made. From the outside, my life looks ""alright"". I never did any hardcore drugs or got into trouble, I work a respectable job making 70k/year remotely that I just got a couple of months ago, I have a decent body that is the result of many gym sessions over the years, I read a lot. But I know that I fell far short of my potential, especially when I had a lot of time stretching ahead of me. My conscience haunts me in the night hours and in the early mornings. There are times when I wake up in the middle of the night feeling massive pangs of anxiety.

We all think we have time when we just leave college and life and potential stretches out before us. ""Tomorrow"", we say. Tomorrow I'll go to the gym. Tomorrow I'll learn that programming language. Next year I'll start saving money. I'll ask that girl out when I'm ready. I'm going to move out when I save up enough. But tomorrow passes and nothing happens. No action is taken. No discipline is executed.

I spent the past 8 years mired in stagnation and mediocrity with various aspects of my lifestyle lagging. What are some of these areas? Let's take dating for example. I am a guy that has never had any success with women. I could have spent some time really getting this area of my life dialed in. I could have gone out on any random night and get rejected (or even a number). I had an entire year in 2018 when I was unemployed and could have done so. But I made excuses. Not enough money, I'm not jacked enough, not funny enough, I still live at home, blah, blah, blah. Now, I'm at an age where I'm behind in this area and it only gets harder. Why? Lack of self-discipline.

I still live at home at an age where I should have been moved out. I moved back in after college and never left. I spent years un/underemployed. I even started a business that exploded in my face. But if I look at it closely, I could have succeed in the business. I could have moved out sooner. But I didn't. Why? Lack of self-discipline.

All of my friends fled back to their home states or moved entirely after college. I have not had a solid social circle since 2013. I put off the hard work of being social and making friends because I said ""I'm going to be moving anyway, not much use in doing it"". That was in 2014. We're still at square one in that area. Why? Lack of self-discipline.

There's many areas we can hone in on. My fitness level is subpar compared to the time I spent on it, my finances are rock bottom, I have little travel experience...so many things. And I now have to give an account of the last 8 years since I left college. I had 8 (well, 7 if you're not counting when we went into lockdown last year) years to capitalize on. What happened in the last 8 years that no lifestyle progress was made? Why did you waste your 20s? Simple. One answer. Lack of self-discipline.

I was reading a quote by Jim Rohn that said something along the lines of ""we will suffer one of two pains in life: the pain of self-discipline or the pain of regret. The only thing is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons"".

I'm dedicating 2022 to extreme lifestyle mastery. The person I am now is not suitable to get me to the next stage. I look back on my life with extreme regret. Most of my friends are married or in a serious relationship and are moving into the next phase of their lives. I can't relate to many people my age. My most crucial period of life - my 20s - I squandered them in isolation, with a lack of drive, and a complete inability to truly challenge myself. I can never get those years back and now I'll just have to pick up the pieces, especially now that we're in a pandemic which makes all of the above harder. 

So to anyone reading this, go through the *pain* of discipline. Get up early, focus on your craft, save money, move out and gain life experiences. Or you surely will go through the *pain* of regret where you look at all lapse of time and realize that you're still the same person with the same issues that you had over a decade ago.",r/getdisciplined,You will either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.

Everyone wants the cheat code for success, but here’s the truth: it doesn’t exist. You don’t win by planning the perfect start or waiting until everything’s just right. You win by starting, learning, adapting, and doing it all over again. You win by being a fucking animal.

As the once-great Conor McGregor said: ""I am not talented, I am obsessed.""

Joe Rogan didn’t start with a £200m Spotify deal - he started with a dodgy webcam, childlike curiosity, and a couple of mates talking nonsense. Fast forward 2,000 episodes, and he’s bigger than every TV host combined. Absolute animal.

Dyson? He didn’t wake up one morning and invent the perfect hoover (yeah, I know “hoover” is technically a brand - don’t come for me, I’m British). It took him over 5,000 tries, but he got there. Animal.

And MrBeast? Easy target for his school bully, no doubt. The guy spent years grinding on YouTube, uploading videos to an audience of fuck all. But he didn’t quit. Kept tweaking, testing, learning. Now? He’s cracked the code and turned into a full-blown beast. Or animal (sorry, had to do it).

Even the Colonel - yeah, the bearded bloke - didn’t start flogging chicken until he was 65. Rejected over a thousand times. A thousand. He might just be the biggest animal of them all.

Here’s the thing: everyone wants to win. Most people love to plan, maybe even start… but hardly anyone sticks around for the long game.

The grind? It’s ugly. It’s boring. It’s demoralising. Those tiny wins? They trick you into thinking you’ve cracked it - right before life delivers a swift kick in the nuts.

Persistence wins. Success isn’t about perfect plans; it’s about pushing through when others quit. And, of course, the researchers had to spell it out for us: a 2023 study by Boss et al. confirms what we all already know - entrepreneurs who persist through setbacks are more likely to succeed. Apparently, persistence isn’t just grit - it’s about iterating through failure and taking small steps, even when you feel stuck. Groundbreaking stuff.

Simple? Yep. Easy? Not at all. Nike didn’t start as a giant - they began pouring rubber into a waffle iron in a kitchen. What the hell’s a waffle iron, you ask? Lucky for you, I googled it. (Who am I kidding, I ChatGPT’d it - honestly, they need to come up with a better verb for that).

For the uninitiated (maybe just me), a waffle iron’s just a gadget for making waffles - crispy, grid-patterned squares you drown in syrup. Or Nutella if you’re feeling cheeky.

So, how’d Nike use one to make shoes? Simple. They were messing around in the kitchen, pouring rubber into the waffle iron to create shoe soles (as you do). Sounds like something you'd do after a few too many, but somehow it worked. And that’s how Nike iterated to a wildly successful product.

Facebook was a glorified phone book for uni students.

Top Gear ripped into Tesla’s first Roadster, calling it a dodgy go-kart with battery problems. That “go-kart” is now patient zero for the EV car virus (who’s triggered?). It wasn’t perfect, but it was the start of something massive.

Most podcasts don’t make it past three episodes. Most businesses don’t survive five years. But the ones who stick around, who persist, who adapt? They end up dominating because everyone else was too busy looking for shortcuts or chasing shiny objects.

So stop waiting for the stars to align. Forget perfect. Perfect is boring. Start messy, learn as you go, and keep showing up. That’s the difference between the people who dream about success and the ones who actually live it.

Now, stop reading this bollocks. The winners aren’t here - they’re out grafting. Quit procrastinating and get back to work.

kl6kr8,"Last year (2019):

* I had no skincare routine
* When I actually read, I only read middle grade and YA books (this includes rereading Percy Jackson for the tenth time)
* I never exercised
* I oftentimes forgot to brush my teeth twice a day
* I rarely ate a vegetable
* I had to turn on the TV to fall asleep

Now:

* I complete a researched skincare routine twice a day
* I read not only twice the number of books, but almost all of them were classics (somehow even managed Moby Dick!)
* I exercise twice a week
* I brush my teeth twice a day no matter what
* I eat at least one serving of vegetables a day
* I meditate every day, as well as use special meditations to fall asleep every day
* I started to practice stoicism
* I just generally took better care of myself

Obviously, I am not perfect now (need more exercise and vegetables, mainly) but I made huge strides this year.

Yet NONE of these was my 2020 resolution. I had only one resolution this year, because rarely have I ever stuck to a resolution, and I wanted to make it INCREDIBLY easy this year. So, what was that resolution?

It was flossing.

Hear me out. I have flossed almost everyday this year and will continue to do the same in the future. But how did flossing cause me to get my life together? The reason is very similar to the *diderot effect.*

For those who don’t know, Diderot lived in the 1700s and was very poor. Then Catherine the Great offered to buy his library for a large sum of money (side note: she let him keep it, and just borrowed books from him). With this, he bought a new scarlet robe. He loved the robe, but soon found that all of his other possessions looked drab in comparison to it. Slowly, he began replacing things in his house with higher-end items that would better match his robe. Before long, Diderot didn’t have any money left.

When we buy a nice item that doesn’t match other items, we will start to replace the other items. This is called the diderot effect.

A similar thing happened to me, only the end result was not debt. I made the resolution to floss, and was determined to keep it. Even if I remembered after I got in bed and was about to fall asleep, I would get up and do it. I made it so there wasn’t an option, as I had already made the choice when I made the resolution. After a little over a month, I was getting the habit and didn’t dread it anymore. So, in my own eyes, I became something more, I became Someone Who Flossed™.

Pretty soon, my nighttime routine looked pretty drab in comparison to my newfound identity (kind of like Diderot, right?). At first, I just made sure to brush my teeth twice a day so that my hard work in flossing wasn’t undone. Then I decided to start a simple skincare routine. To do this, I happened to buy a product with salicylic acid in it that helped my acne significantly. Because of this, I got super into skincare and started a full-fledged routine by browsing [r/SkincareAddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/) and skincare videos on YouTube. After a month, I became Someone Who Had a Skincare Routine™ as well as Someone Who Flossed™.

These became a part of my identity, but other parts of my life were looking bad in comparison. Also, in my mind, people who floss everyday and have a skincare routine not only have their life together, but are just more advanced at life. Because of this I tried reading more adult-level books, like The Shining and 1984. Then I picked up Crime and Punishment and fell in love. For the first time, I realized old classics are actually very interesting and fun, especially Russian classics. Thus, I started reading only these (and I’m still working my way through the most popular classics). As a result, I became Someone Who Reads Classics™.

I think you all see the trend here. Exercise and meditation were added after I took that free Yale course, “The Science of Well Being” (which I highly recommend).

What does this mean for you?

Maybe other people can have a similar experience, in the same way Diderot’s experience became common. If anything, you could make it your resolution to floss this upcoming year, like I did. Otherwise, pick a different, very easy resolution that you associate with people who have their lives together. Even if you want to have other resolutions, just make this one the one you don’t have a choice but to stick to. Worse comes to worse, nothing else changes but your dentist is very happy with you.

I know this sounds a little gimmicky, but it really worked for me, so I wanted to share. Let me know if you have any questions.

Tldr: The resolution was flossing. I changed everything else to become the type of person I thought someone who flosses was. It’s kind of hard to explain concisely, but it’s similar to the diderot effect.

Edit: I'm so pleasantly surprised at the number of people saying they're going to do this as well. Please feel free to comment your progress (or lack of it) on this post in the future. Also, I want to emphasize how long this process took. I only added a second habit after two full months of flossing.

lboq8b,"Look. I know you think you were born damaged.

I know you’re convinced that you’re weak and pathetic given your lousy track-record of self-control.

I just want you to know—no, *I need you to know* —that none of that is true. You’re not broken, in fact you’re the opposite of broken. You’re functioning *exactly as you were designed*.

All those vices you’re consuming; all that procrastination; all that binging on Reddit, then Youtube, then streaming TV; it’s just your way of pacifying and coping with that constant pain and unease you feel 24/7.

It’s not just you who feels it; it’s all of us.

So where does this pain come from? Why are we so restless and unsatisfied? It’s not like we’re lacking in anything fundamental. It’s not like we have much of a reason to feel this way, right?

It’s kind of messed up, but we—humans—were *designed* to be perpetually unhappy.

More accurately, we just fell into being this way over millions of years of evolution. Like how natural selection brought us opposable thumbs and peripheral vision, the same survival forces brought us this constant hum of discontent.

The reason for this is simple: motivation. Evolution favored our discontented ancestors because they worked harder; they were more likely to survive. Their dissatisfaction and unhappiness fueled their motivation to get out there, take risks, use energy and change things for their advantage.

A perpetual hum of discontent was thus wired into our species with the sole purpose to be motivated.\*

I know what you’re thinking. *That’s all great for cavemen or whatever, but this doesn’t apply to me. I’m miserable as fck, and yet I feel the opposite of motivation. Most if the time, all I feel is a depressing apathy.*

I know that feeling all too well.

I encourage you to take a step back for a second. Look beyond you bubble and your daily self-discipline attempts and failures. Instead, consider the world around you and put things in proper context in terms of how our environment has changed since the days we roamed the African Savannahs.

When our ancestors were motivated to relieve the discontent; when they decided to do something to scratch the uncomfortable itch of a craving… *They had to work for it.*

They had to take on risks and endure long and dangerous missions and quests. In their world of scarcity and danger, relief never came easy. There was always a cost of time (days) + energy (thousands of calories) + risk (potential death).

The trade between the time/effort/risk and reward was balanced.

Today, it’s a whole other game.

With our modern-day vices, the cost of reward has been eliminated. The time to reward is now seconds; the energy involved is the fraction of a calorie it takes to tap a screen; the risk non-existent.

This sounds amazing—and in many ways living in our modern utopia of abundance and security really is exactly that—but this has consequences. There are side effects.

On the societal level we have the obesity epidemic and unprecedented rates of addiction, depression and anxiety. **Since we don’t have a frame of reference of what it was like before, we’ve collectively decided to shrug and say, ‘this is normal… humans are just impulsive, irrational, lazy and inherently ungrateful creatures.’**

But this is **not** normal.

Normal was: you were fearful, dissatisfied, horny and hungry, so you were motivated to seek out and protect against predators and other dangers; you formed tenuous but crucial alliances; you found and courted a mate (while trying not to get killed for approaching the wrong one), and you hunted for what sure as hell did not want to be hunted.

Normal was: you did all those things, you hopefully survived another day, then you went to sleep utterly spent but with a brief moment of serenity and inner-satisfaction.

Normal was: you woke up to a new set of needs and threats, but luckily dissatisfaction was there to motivate you onwards.

Things have changed for us in the blink of an eye. We now live in the *abnormal*.

Abnormal is: you feel fearful, dissatisfied, horny and hungry, so you’re motivated to… grab your phone, scroll through news and outrage comments on Reddit and Twitter, feel pings of pretend status with social media, fap to 14 hyper-fertile women, and inhale some ultra processed and high caloric food.

Abnormal is: doing all those things, which works insanely well and fast to quiet and numb the inner discontent, but then it snaps back up and so you’re compelled to do them again and again and again until you blunt your brain’s pleasure receptors making it require even more for the same relief and reward.

Abnormal is going to bed with nothing substantial to show for your day; ruminating and stressed from procrastinating on all your modern obligations and long-term worries—paying the rent, getting good grades, landing a job amidst record unemployment, getting fired because a robot can soon do your job, bracing for the next economic collapse…

Abnormal is then waking the next day, with the same heavy burden, but with the same wired ‘motivation’ to relieve it quickly, but mistakenly and temporarily and *stupidly*, through your vice.

We live in abnormal times. We just weren’t made for this place.

So what’s the solution?

Now that you learned and know what’s going on. You can start by forgiving yourself.

Breathe a little sigh of relief.

Allow for some much needed understanding and compassion. You deserve it.

Step two is to adapt to this reality.

First you can deal with the low hanging fruit.

Webblockers.

This might seem odd, but as much as strive to I love myself and am grateful for who I am, et certera, I DON’T EFFING TRUST MYSELF. The self I'm talking about is my spongy brain matter that evolved for a different world—the part makes drives impulses, makes snap decisions; the part of me that thinks opening Reddit to a fresh set of tantalizing posts right when it’s time to work, is a good idea.

I stopped trusting those impulses and clever rationalizations and excuses; but I’ve since learned it's a clever bugger and knows how to override my conscious attempts to ignore it, so I put up some obstacles.\*\*

Next, I put certain systems in place.

I work with a modified Pomodoro technique where I book-end each session with instances of being mindful of my thoughts, feelings, emotions. This has proven to be key. Just observing all that inner discontent and its motley crew of ill feelings—craving, Resistance, regret, anxiety, boredom, overwhelm—and allowing for some space to respond, rather than react and grab at a vice for relief, has been huge.

Sure, being mindful of those uncomfortable feelings is, well, uncomfortable no put it mildly—but that’s the price I must decide to pay every day. The trade is fair: a little pain and discomfort in exchange for some motivation to do meaningful work (like writing this post). It’s an investment; one that pays off later in small doses of happiness and peace of mind.

bbr86u,"One tendency I've noticed about a lot of us who are into self-development is that we are incredibly hungry for information.

Some of us may have had neglectful parents or an upbringing that was very scarce, we may have not gotten the encouragement for self-betterment, we have no one around us who are striving for the best -- so we want to consume and process all the information, methods, tips, and tricks we can.

I think that's great because being deeply desirous to change yourself is better than being apathetic and lethargic.

Unfortunately, this over-consumption of information can become gluttony. Gluttony then leads to lethargy, which then leads to sloth and not doing anything with this information.

More books! More articles! More podcasts! More lectures! More, more, more! I need to know the secrets of the universe before I end up starting my business, before I apply for that job, before I take that trip, before I ask out that girl.

We need to be perfect and then, then we'll act. One day. One day.

But one day never comes. Neither does perfection.

The real truth about self-development, the real pain is the application. It's in the messy interactions between imperfect human beings.

You've read what's in that book about dating. Now, go out on a Friday night and apply it.

You've read how to start a business. Now, start your own.

A lot of people are dreaming with their heads up in the clouds, thinking they're moving the needle when they're just reading a book or an article online.

How many people are out there actively trying, failing, getting knocked down on their ass, and trying again? Very few.

Most people read about a diet in a book, try it for 2 months, then relapse into their old eating habits.

Many people say “I'm gonna meditate for 20 minutes a day” but they “can't find the time...because Netflix”.

Then people wonder why 2019 is 2018 is 2017 is 2016. Repeating a fucking Groundhog Day existence for 30 years.

Then you'll be 68 years old and realize that you just twiddled your thumbs in your ivory tower while your life passed you by.

Because the real pain of self-development is exertion, it's doing it when you don't want to do it, it's progressively getting better and actively cutting out areas where you don't need to be doing things.

What methods work? **They all work.** There are some that are more ""optimal"" than others, but they will all work - if applied. If you read a self-help book starting from ground zero (like you know **nothing** about this stuff), you will be a better person on page 258 than you were at page 1. I guarantee it. So it's not about ""choosing the right methods"". It's about **application**.

There are people who think self-development and self-help is a joke. These people have never even walked into a book store and yet they're laughing all the way to the bank or living the life that we want to live!

I can pretty much guarantee that if you took one book like Deep Work or Psycho-Cybernetics and applied everything in there to the T, your life would dramatically alter.

You wouldn't need to be browsing Inc. magazine for the newest hacks. You wouldn't need to go on Entrepreneur and say you're “hustling”.

We need to throw ourselves into the task with everything we have and not look around for another hack or tactic to help us when we have an arsenal of 1,000 inside our head.

hfoes5,"Procrastination is something we all do. So is feeling bad about procrastination. But here's the crazy thing: even though this is a shared human experience, it's a sign that our approach to self-discipline is to shame ourselves and beat ourselves up, rather than understanding *why* we procrastinate.

##Procrastination is not about laziness, but task avoidance

The first thing to do is to realize that procrastination doesn't make you lazy. **Procrastinating means you associate this task with pain.** 

That's it.

> ""We believed that it was poor time management and that if we just worked a bit harder and had more self-discipline, we could do the job,"" [said researcher Tim Pychyl]

[Source: the CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-for-june-14-2020-1.5604357/there-s-a-reason-we-procrastinate-and-it-s-not-laziness-1.5604433?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

The solution is not to work harder, to sit there and painfully force yourself to get to work. **All this does is associate your task with pain.** You're punishing yourself for taking on the task, and you're only reinforcing the negative association.

Approaching it this way, it's only a matter of time before you avoid pain and revert to reward-seeking behaviors. It's how we're all wired. 

You're not lazy. You just have the wrong associations for this task.

> So it's about our feelings, it's not just a matter of buckling down and getting it done. **There are negative emotions associated with doing a set task and we know how to get rid of them: avoid the task.**

So what do you do? 

**First things first:** stop punishing yourself for procrastinating. Stop feeling like you're lazy. Stop beating yourself up and saying ""why can't I do this?"" Instead, realize that you just have your wires crossed. And you need to know how to uncross them.

##A quick method for undermining your urge to procrastinate

So if procrastination is the result of bad associations, what do you do to fix it? You have to train yourself to make a positive association with the task itself. [Here's how Terry Crews does it to work out two hours a day](https://lifehacker.com/terry-crews-fitness-secret-treat-the-gym-like-a-spa-1744582572).

> **It has to feel good.** I tell people this a lot - go to the gym, and just sit there, and read a magazine, and then go home. And do this every day. Go to the gym, don’t even work out. Just GO. Because the habit of going to the gym is more important than the work out. Because it doesn’t matter what you do. **You can have fun — but as long as you’re having fun, you continue to do it.**

Now this is good advice, and it became viral, but I would argue that for people with extreme procrastination, even going to the gym when you can just chill at home sounds like a task worth avoiding.

In dog training, we use positive reinforcements to slowly and incrementally build up your association of a specific task with feelings of reward and pleasure. For this example, we'll use ""cleaning the bathroom,"" but you can apply this to just about anything you procrastinate with.

* **Use laughably small tasks, if you must.** If necessary, start *stupidly* small. For example, let's say you always procrastinate cleaning the bathroom. Start today by telling yourself that you're going to walk into the bathroom - that's it, just walk in. 
* **Practice making the smallest tasks rewarding.** Do your laughably small task. Next, reward yourself with a pat on the back, or play some music, etc. The goal isn't to clean the bathroom, remember. It's to associate cleaning the bathroom with good feelings. That starts by just associating the bathroom with reward, not with ""ugh, I have to clean all of this stuff."" Don't take on a big task that feels painful yet. You want to undo the association of ""work = pain."" Don't expand the task until the laughably small version of it feels rewarding.
* **Give yourself a reward cue.** For example, if you set an Alexa timer for five minutes of bathroom cleaning, use that timer as the cue to give yourself a reward. You'll start to associate the feeling of that cue with being free and having a task completed, as well as the reward itself. You'll know this starts to become a habit when you start to picture the task itself by imagining how good you feel when that cue hits.
* **Always keep the pleasure outweighing the pain.** You can slowly add more work into this routine, but make sure that you keep the rewards heavy, especially at first. They should outweigh the pain. The sooner you revert back to ""work = pain"" habits, the sooner you'll revert back to avoidance and procrastination.

Does it sound like you're training yourself? Good. Because that's exactly what you're doing. Dog trainers do this with dogs all the time; they slowly introduce ideas at first (like getting used to a harness). They don't put the harness on the dog right away. They introduce the harness, associate it with a reward, and slowly and incrementally build on that until the dog associates harness time with positive rewards.

You're more sophisticated than a dog, of course. But it doesn't mean that you're exempt from this rule. 

Procrastination is not laziness. When you procrastinate, it's because it's *exactly* what you feel you should be doing. You're just succumbing to feelings of pain over feelings of reward.

It's the feeling associated with the task that's the problem, and it's why even breaking something down into bite-sized chunks isn't quite enough. The task has to be associated with reward if you're going to keep coming back to it.

**tl;dr** Procrastination isn't laziness or a character flaw. It's basic task avoidance. We avoid tasks because we perceive them as tasks of pain, not reward. Progressively change this association by breaking it down into small, (and also highly rewarding) tasks and you'll overcome the urge to procrastinate. **And make sure to avoid beating yourself up for starting a task and not finishing it.** That only makes a negative association with starting work.

ku0nlf,"From the Japanese writer’s point of view, “writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity,” spending his days running and swimming to build up his endurance, as well as competing in marathons and triathlons.

At the start of his writing career, Murakami also ran a small jazz club in Tokyo, where he worked until the early hours of the morning, before going home to write.

After he decided to commit his life entirely to writing, Murakami and his wife, Yoko, closed the bar and moved out to Narashino, a more rural area in the Chiba prefecture of Tokyo.

From there, the writer overhauled his lifestyle and daily routine completely, “once I was sitting at a desk writing all day I started putting on the pounds. I was also smoking too much—sixty cigarettes a day. My fingers were yellow, and my body reeked of smoke. This couldn’t be good for me, I decided. If I wanted to have a long life as a novelist, I needed to find a way to stay in shape.”

In Murakami’s new daily routine, if he’s in novel mode, he’ll wake up at 4am and immediately start writing, working for five to six hours. If he’s not in novel mode, Murakami and his wife will still wake up early, “once I began my life as a novelist, my wife and I decided that we’d go to bed soon after it got dark and wake up with the sun,” typically waking up before 5am and going to bed at 10pm.

While some people may imagine the life of a writer as balancing long stretches of idleness with flash in pan inspiration moments, the reality is that writing, and creativity, is more of a steady grind. Murakmai says, “I have to pound away at a rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of my creativity” — a sentiment which reflects his structured routine and lifestyle.

Murakami will typically finish up his day’s writing at 10am or 11am. From there, he’ll proceed to his physical training.

>In the afternoon, I run for 10km or swim for 1500m (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9:00 pm. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.

2. **Accept** it (the feeling is already within you; trying to distract yourself from it or trying to reject it is only going to make you suffer more---you don't have to keep doing this to yourself. Peace is *beneath* the pain within you. Peace is not outside of you)
3. **Investigate. Listen** to it (ask it: ""What are you trying to tell me? What do you need the most right now?""). Then *listen* as if you were listening for a top-secret message being whispered by a tiny kitten (listen with utmost care, attention, and Love for yourself)
4. **Nurture** it (love yourself through the pain. Remind yourself of what you are capable of doing. Remind yourself that if you *don't* know what to do, you can always seek help. Just love yourself here, however feels most healing to you)

j6xes5,"1. Your self-love must be stronger than your desire to be loved:

If you're not happy now, there's no amount of followers, positive social media comments, or Instagram likes that will change that. External validation isn't happiness - it's a
hamster wheel. Validation is an inside job. The most convincing sign that someone is truly living their ""best life"", is their lack of desire to show the world that they're living their best life.
Your ""best life"" won't seek external validation, but insecurity continually will.

2. You are always responsible for your emotional reactions:

If you get angry and say ""X thing made me angry"", you will get angry often.
If you get angry and say: ""I made myself angry because of X thing"" you will get angry less often.
All of your emotional responses are your
fault and responsibility. Nothing can make you angry. Your thoughts about what
happened made you angry. That's on you. If you realize that, you'll have the power to control it. If you don't, you'll spend your life triggered easily and unhappy often.

3. Don't feed your problems with thoughts, starve them with action:

If you want to feed a problem, keep thinking about it.
If you want to starve a problem, take action.
Most of the harm starts in your mind, with you and your thoughts.
Most of the solutions start with a decision, courage, and action.

4. Life has an algorithm too:

Just like social media has algorithms to give you more of what you're interested in, life has an algorithm that gives you more of what
you're thinking about and focusing on. You can train your algorithm to make you more anxious, worried, or insecure by focusing on negative things.
You can train your algorithm for happiness, success, and growth by focusing on positive things.
Your thoughts become your decisions and then your actions your focus becomes your future.

5. If they're real,
they'll want to see you win:

If you ever feel nervous telling a friend or partner your good news, don't. Get new friends or a new partner.
You can't afford to have people in close proximity that don't want to see you succeed, grow, and progress.
They'll subtly hold you back with snide comments, negative feedback, and casual pessimism.
In the short term, they'll have a small effect, but in the long term, they'll lead you away from your potential and towards the same negativity that has consumed their lives.

6. Your life will be defined by your ability to handle uncertainty:

To get from a miserable place to a happy place, you have to be brave enough to travel through a scary, vulnerable, lonely place called uncertainty.
Choosing uncertainty over the certain misery of your current situation is a decision you'll have to make many times if you want success and happiness in work, love, and life. You'll be defined by your ability to handle uncertainty. Avoidance all risk is the biggest
risk. Don't fear the unknown.

7. You have nothing to ""find"":

""Finding yourself"" is a pop culture lie.
""Finding your passion"" is a pop culture lie. ""Finding your soulmate"" is a pop culture lie.
These pop culture lies, and the perfection they promise us, if we would only keep searching, stop us from working through the natural challenges within our careers, relationships, and within ourselves.
There is no perfection, only room for improvement.

8. Your mental diet will determine your mental health:

Comfort eating on negativity will make you unhealthy, and mental weight is the hardest to lose. Like fast food, negativity often tastes good in the short term, but will make you unhealthy in the long term.
Your mental diet consists of what you watch, what you read, who you follow, who you spend time with, what you say, and what you think.
If your goal is to have a healthier mind this year, start by removing all the junk food in your diet.

Then a few days ago I stumbled upon [Huberman's podcast on dopamine](https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU). It didn't directly touch on discipline, but understanding how dopamine works was the key for me to 'getdisciplined'.


Practical take-aways that have been working really well for me: 

1. To get started, break up high dopamine activities. **Don't layer high dopamine activities**. Spread them out. e.g. Porn, break, masturbate, break, drink. This counts for healthy activities too. Don't eat and watch your favourite show at the same time, even if it's healthy food.
2. **Don't peak your dopamine before or after work/study**. I'm trying to learn Japanese. It's hard and boring. But only because I do high level dopmine activities before it and/or after. If you drop those, or do them later on in the day, after only a couple of days studying becomes a lot easier and more fun. The activity itself gives me the most dopamine.
3. **Don't start your day with a high dopamine activity**. So studying first thing in the morning is a good idea. Maybe meditate or do something you've always wanted to get good at. This allows you to slowly raise your dopamine level, cementing that activity in your mind as pleasurable. Don't forget rule 2 though.
4. If you're completely unmotivated; **move first thing in the morning**. Go for a walk. Movement releases dopamine (without cause too much of a peak). Have a warm shower and gently make it as cold as you can handle. Warm up through movement after. This raises your baseline dopamine for several hours so you can get things done.
5. **Look for things you're grateful for (about what your doing) while studying/working**. This gives you small peaks of dopamine that train you to enjoy what your doing, even if right now it's kinda boring. Give it a couple of days.
6. **Don't reward yourself every time**. This one's a bit counterintuitive, but the (expected) reward will spike your dopamine and make the activity itself less pleasurable. If you then don't get the reward for some reason, the activity will seem less attractive. Randomise when you get the reward. This is why gambling and lootboxes are so addictive, use it to your advantage. Personally I haven't implemented this point yet, I just don't reward myself.

Instead, it works through three surprisingly humane ideas:

* Laziness is an illusion
* Resistance is information
* Strategic positioning > brute force

And what we call laziness is usually the mind doing a risk-reward calculation behind the scenes.

If the task feels unclear, misaligned, or emotionally heavy, your brain signals: don’t do it. But instead of interpreting that signal, we label ourselves “lazy” and try to power through.

The Samurai didn’t do that. When they paused, it wasn’t procrastination but perception. They used resistance like a compass.

You don’t like your current life; you don’t like the way things are going—from your day to day behaviors and habits, to your obligations and the vision of what your life will look like a month, a year, 5 years from today—so… *so*… you want to make big changes.

You want to *use* that dislike, to leverage it, and get it to induce self-discipline and propel you towards a better life.

I hear you. I’ve been there.

Perhaps you’re on a career path that doesn’t interest you. At times you friggin' hate it. So you want to use that hate to push you into working on something you’re *actually* passionate about.

Maybe your self-image—the way you see your outer body and inner self-worth—is at an all-time low. You want to use that discontentment to drive you onto better habits.

And of course you compare yourself to others—we’re humans and that’s just what we do—so you can’t help but feel down about all the fun, success and peace of mind they get to enjoy while you're relegated to the sidelines. You want to use the envy and resentment and vehement desire to stop procrastinating and take action to get a slice of that happy pie.

Like I said, your logic here makes sense:

>I don’t like the way things are going today → therefore I will change using that dislike as fuel. I will use the resentment, pain and yearning to break out of this eternal rut.

The things is (and I learn this the hard way btw) this doesn’t work.

As Marsellus Wallace would say “You came close but you never made it. And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.”

So let me say it plainly.

Motivation can’t be fueled by negativity.

*Motivation cannot be fueled by negativity.*

The reason for this is simple. **Negativity only does one thing: it drives you to your vice.**

Think about your past. What happens when you felt anything remotely painful or uncomfortable? What were you compelled to do? You reached for Reddit, YouTube, social media, Netflix, junk food... right?

This is what is hard-wired in your mind: resentment, yearning, regret, worries, stress, unfulfilled desires… they can all be instantly relieved with your vices.

No matter how much your conscious mind yammers away about the little investments needed to actually deal with these things, your subconscious, the emotional part of you that *actually* drives behavior, will just laugh and say, “Hmm, I guess we *could* do it your way… or…*or!...* we could fix things now and with zero effort. Yeah, we’re just going to go with that.”

…

But wait.

People do make changes, right?

The obese guy loses 100 lbs. The alcoholic cleans up and now spends her time volunteering as a sponsor. The delinquent teen changes course and becomes a successful entrepreneur.

So how?

Here’s the thing. Here’s what took me *years* and an immeasurable amount of struggle, pain and denial to realize and fully accept:

Positive changes in behavior, leading to tangible improvements to your life, they are much more likely to happen if you are perfectly content with the way things are.

Let me say it again.

**Positive changes will happen once you’ve accepted the way things are.**

*Huh? Like, that makes no sense. I mean, why would anybody makes changes if they were content with the way things are?*

I just see it as another one of life’s cruel paradoxes (but that make perfect sense once you come to live it).

Motivation only works forward. It won’t show up if you’re obsessed with wanting to move *away* from a life or career path you hate and resent.

It’s a cat. It won’t come if you chase it out of your petty needs—if it feels like you are desperate for it.

No, you have just to let it be. You have to first figure out a way to be at peace with the present moment. Accepting of the way things are.

Only then will the motivation and energy for more and better show up.

…

While this perplexing (and frankly *inconvenient*) truth takes time to root in your mind, I’d like to share a bit of my story which exemplifies this to a T. It’ll also show you how I came about breaking out of my rut—what I did and what tool I used—despite that nagging paradox.

So let’s go back to 2007. I was in school, on a career trajectory in which I was indifferent to at best, and *absolutely loathed* at worst. And it was usually the latter.

Like you, I was painfully aware of (and tried to be grateful for) the many blessings and privileges I was born into, yet I pretty much hated my life.

I was miserable. I longed for a way out.

And then it came.

There it was on display at the bookstore. *The Four-Hour-Workweek* by Timothy Ferris. A little book promising me a way to quit the rat race of a conventional career and join in on a thrilling life of being my own boss and travelling the world.

I can still take myself back to those moments, sitting on a grassy hill on campus under a warm sun, cracking it open for the first time, my mind slowly erupting with ideas.

Potential. So much dam potential, it was unreal.

Soon after, my life became split in two.

There was reality… school and then the career part of my life, my obligations, the stuff I hated, *that I loathed* , but that I just had to do (and boy did I procrastinate on that stuff).

And then there were the fantasies. The dream life. *The side project*. My ticket to freedom. I just needed to ride it for a while and I would get to the promised land.

But I kept falling off the dang train.

So it went.

For years. Idea after idea. One step forward, 8 steps back. Failure after failure.

Frustration, desperation, depression, apathy, anger. As the years went on, this off-hue rainbow of negative emotions would aggravate and amplify. Each time I began a new attempt to break out of my rut I willed them to motivate me—to propel me to work, to get me to get sh\*t done once and for all.

It never worked.

The more I tried to use that negativity, the more I tried to force myself out of a festering resentment of my life, the harder I crashed when my willpower got spent and I snapped back down, while of course, bingeing on my vices.

...

Fast forward 13 years. April 2020.

I had just come back from a travel sabbatical. It was the second time I took time off my day job to free up time and dedicate myself to a side project. Once again, things never took off, not even close.

It wasn’t because the market didn’t want my product; it never even got to that. For much of the trip, motivation evaded me and my bad habits took over. Resistance (aka that ‘*ugh I just don’t feel like working’* feeling) was my biggest enemy. I never stood a chance.

So after the usual sad fanfare, I decided to yet again to give up and go back to my day job.

There was however going to be a difference this time. I decided to take a step back and challenge my decades-held assumptions and beliefs.

I spoke to people, first some friends and eventually a mental health professional. I spoke about these beliefs—plucking them from where they festered unmolested for decades and exposing them to the light of scrutiny and reasoning.

Here’s a fun exercise: take some belief that 17-year-old you came up with as a coping mechanism and attempt to explain and justify it to someone. You’re going to have a hard time.

So yeah. I slowly began to realize that the truth was caked over with years of stories I was telling myself. Years of me insisting that I hated my career; years of me seeking and holding onto scraps of evidence that it was boring or hard or unfulfilling—that I hated every aspect of it and there was nothing redeeming about it.

With help, I did the work of taking a pick-axe to all of those layers and I discovered the truth: there is nothing inherently wrong with my career.

If I focused squarely on the present moment—which by then I had started making a habit out of when I discovered mindfulness as a means to manage depression—there was never anything *wrong* with it. My job was always just ‘insert this number in that Excel box’. Then ‘write this word, then that word'. Then ‘deal with this person by email’, etc.

It wasn’t actually this abhorrent boogeyman that my immature mind conjured up years ago as a juvenile response to the realities of adulting. Yes, it wasn’t my passion. Yes, is was often boring AF. Yes, it didn’t allow for me to live on a beach in Argentina like Timothy Effing Ferris. But it *just wasn’t that bad.*

Even when it did ‘suck’, even when it got objectively tedious, or stressful, or frustrating, I always had a choice.

The Buddha says ‘suck’ aka pain is inevitable. Suffering is not. Suffering is how you respond to pain. And my default for over a decade was to mindlessly wallow in the pain. To ruminate and tell myself I hated this and this would be my future forever and ever. My beliefs lead to my suffering. Simple as that.

But that wasn’t the truth. The truth is, *it isn’t that bad*. Come to think of it, it was fine. It was stable and secure. It paid the bills and allowed me to live comfortably during the evenings and weekends. The stress could be reduced with simple time management practices and an open conversation with my manager every now and then.

So, when I returned to the job, I decided to just let it be. To come in without any prejudice. To rediscover, moment by moment, as much as I could whether I really did ‘hate’ my career.

Turns out I didn’t. Turns out I don’t.

Then… when I least expected it, guess who came sauntering into my life all casual, like no big deal. That little f\*\*ker of a cat.

Motivation.

…

Today, as I try to maintain this mental calm of acceptance and gratitude of what is—and again I hold no delusions, there are times when it does indeed suck—I find myself infinitely more motivated and less inclined to procrastinate. The work just happens.

Now, when the Pomodoro bell chimes after I churned out a solid hour of work, I get up and I fist pump the air while telling myself how awesome it is to be able to exchange some honest work for a fair wage.

...And that’s for my work-work. My obligations.

It’s still too early to speak of a great success story for my side project; but one thing is certain. I don’t have motivation issues anymore. I mean, the fact that I woke up at 5:45 am to finish up this essay is a little testament to it.

Whether it succeeds or not is beyond my control and the odds are stacked against it; but funny enough, I don’t care as much as I once did. I don’t *need* it to work anymore, lest I be doomed. I’ll be fine either way. It’s the work I like; if a little fruit buds out of it, even better.

I sincerely wish the same for you.

\- Simon ㋛

nprj8e,"A lot of people including me think that five years from now I will be doing this and living like this. It is good to visualise and have affirmations but no one knows the tomorrow, we can visualise it or manifest it but unless we don't take the action today, the tomorrow won't come.

I think we need to focus on the 24 hrs rather than a month or two to see changes.

Have an end goal in mind but focus on today. You have 24 hrs to change your tomorrow and make it more predictable. 

Rather than thinking it will take a month or two to see the changes, think about today. Just the 24 hrs, forget everything   else.

The reason we procrastinate a lot is because we want to see quick changes and knowing it will take time will make us have second thoughts or just procrastinate more. Instead, just focusing on the 24 hrs allows us to see more changes quickly since a day passes quicker than a month. 

So if you workout today, get the project started today, etc. At the end of the day you can look and see the changes you made in your life within a day. Then next day again it starts from zero and again you put efforts and see the quick changes.

This will eventually lead to achieving the bigger changes and goals you want to achieve.",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] It's not about tomorrow or 5 years from now. What you do today decides your tomorrow or the next 5 years,2272,
ljyrge,"A month ago I finished *A Monk's Guide to a Clean House and Mind* by Shoukei Matsumoto, and it has had a pretty sizable impact on my focus, productivity, and well-being.

Like many on r/getdisciplined, I have had good weeks and bad weeks trying to better myself and instill new habits.  Until I started cleaning regularly I didn't realize that merely having a messy room, no matter whether I was in it or not, was affecting how I treated my habits, my relationships, and myself. For me, cleaning is now the foundation for all of my other habits.

Some notable things that I really enjoyed from Matsumoto's book are the following:

* Monks make a habit of cleaning every day, using it as a time to commune with nature and oneself.
* How one cleans is a reflection of one's heart
* When cleaning, monks do not wish to be somewhere else or doing something different.  They focus on making the best of the tasks they have in front of them

Cleaning can be a difficult task to start with, as it often feels like it's getting in the way of things that have a more tangible result.  However, the peace I've felt from focusing on cleaning has rippled through my life in how I organize everything and has quickly become one of the most important tasks on my to-do list.

l9yp3m,"I saw this quote a couple of weeks ago and it hit deep.

In my younger years, I had the misconception that sticking to habits and disciplines restricted my freedom and wouldn't be any fun.

After graduating college with no job lined up and no skills to back it up since I did the bare minimum to graduate and partied a decent amount, I realized the freedom I sought actually created more stress and problems.

I spent the next few ""adulting"" years frantically devouring self-development books, learning and implementing habit principles and systems religiously (with plenty of failures along the way), and came to the conclusion as Jocko Willink noted, that the true formula is ""Discipline = Freedom.""

A fitness habit may seem to be taking away your energy and time, but it actually energizes your life force and allows you to experience more of life.

A reading habit may seem to be boring, but it is actually multiplying your future income and making you an indispensable professional.

A healthy eating habit may seem restrictive, but it is actually allowing you to indulge in desserts and fried foods occasionally without guilt.

A saving habit may seem no fun, but it is actually giving you options to make career and life pivots in the long run even if there is an economic crisis.

Easier said than done, but when you honor your disciplines frequently or even better daily, it will protect you like no other in the face of life's unpredictability and thus giving you true freedom.

I wished someone would have told me earlier to invest in my daily habits, rituals, and disciplines as it was truly a game-changer.

mefzbm,"# The Key to Habit Mastery

Humans are innately wired to take the path of least resistance, and it seems most things in the universe have this bias.

Water and electricity flow through the path of least resistance.

An object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force.

A person binging Netflix will stay lying on their ass unless acted on by an outside force.

If we look from an evolutionary context, our bias to be lazy has good intentions.

Primal man did not have UberEATS or Dominos Pizza delivery on standby – Every day was a bitter struggle for survival.

A human who expanded their energy doing unproductive things like dancing in a tree for several hours or digging random holes was more likely to get eaten by a sabre-tooth tiger.

Meanwhile, his ‘lazy’ friends had the energy to run away.

Modern humans, through the rapid advancements of civilisation, have been blessed to focus on the higher rungs of [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.).

The problem is our primal programming still persists.

You want to start a new habit, but the older regions of your brain demand otherwise.

The same brain that saw tree dancing as a waste of time now sees exercise,

studying, journaling, business creation and meditation as the biggest possible waste of your energy.

Remember, this brain is wired for short-term gratification not long-term fulfillment.

Primal man likely didn’t even have 30 years to live so everything had to be optimised for the now.

A trick needs to be employed to counteract this old programming and get the ball rolling.

**The 2-Minute Rule**

If you want to start a new habit, commit to doing it for only two minutes.

Two minutes is a small enough window to overcome much of the mental resistance.

The key to making this work is to allow yourself to be satisfied with doing just two minutes without judgement.

You need to see the two minutes as a legitimate success.

When we attempt to create a new habit we often set high expectations of ourselves.  
We want to:

• Exercise six days a week.

• Cut out all carbs from our diet cold turkey.

• Start programming an app with minimum programming experience.

• Create a business that makes $20,000 per month without ever making $20.

Unrealistic goals require too much willpower to maintain. You might stick with them for a while but eventually you will give up.

The 2-minute rule allows you to first create the habit before going deep.

Once the initiation of the habit becomes subconscious rather than conscious everything is suddenly easier.

**A Business Parallel**

In business, companies are willing to spend a large percentage of their money on acquiring a new customer.

It often costs a fraction of a marketing budget to retain an existing customer.

Existing customers (for example people who love Coke) can stay with a brand for several years or even a lifetime.

A devout lover of Coke is unlikely to replace Coke with Pepsi, even if Pepsi might taste better.

Coke to them occupies a place in their minds which is incredibly difficult to remove.

You can see the same pattern in people who are devout followers of Apple’s iPhone; they tend to avoid Android like the plague.

It doesn’t matter if an Android phone objectively performs better than their iPhone.

They will still fight vehemently for their brand like Mongols under Kublai Khan.

The point here is **the mental battle is the hardest to overcome**.

Once your mind accepts a product or habit as being a part of your identity, loyalty becomes the inevitable response.

**How I used this in my life**

For a long time I struggled to make yoga a habit.

I wanted to gain some of the benefits of the practice but could never get into it.

Periodically I would start and stop the habit.

Getting on the mat and doing foreign poses for 30 minutes was a tedious task.

After failing to be consistent for several months, I decided to commit to just doing 1 or 2 poses every morning (downward facing dog and child’s pose).

I did this for a week or two and then started adding other poses to my little routine.

After a month I was averaging 20 minutes every day.

I knew it became a habit when it felt **wrong** going to bed without doing yoga for the day.

I employed the same approach to journaling.

I first committed to writing one or two sentences about the day and listing the foods I ate.

With time, the journaling practice got more elaborate and it became another daily habit.

**Your Blueprint**

1. Find a habit that will improve your life.
2. Allow yourself to do the bare minimum (2 minutes) per day.
3. Do the habit every day until it becomes enjoyable.
4. Naturally add more variety and complexity to the habit.
5. Experience the amazing long-term benefits.

Use it wisely,",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] How a VERY simple shift in thinking changed my life,2212,
dndnjr,"Ok so it was a while when I stumbled upon a book called ""Running on Empty: Overcome Your Childhood Emotional Neglect"" by Jonice Webb(thank you, a redditor who advised it). I couldn't be fanboying over it more.
 It was an amazing read. It can be helpful for anybody here, who comes from a normal family, wasn't blatantly abused physically/mentally, but still finds themselves in a dark place overeating, overspending, procrastinating, showing signs of depression, etc. This book can explain A LOT, I swear. Or, not this particular book, but anything concerning childhood emotional neglect.

Self-discipline, knowing when to rest and when to work, forcing yourself to do something when needed, etc - all of these are SKILLS that you simply might not have been taught. Lack of them doesn't mean that you are ungrateful or dumb, you just. Don't know how to do it. Because you were never taught! 

On my own example: I come from a regular okay family, I've been granted a lot. If I'm not successful, that's on me, right? Except for...
How was I supposed to be self-disciplined when my parents were working day and night and I was mainly on my own? A child can't figure this out themselves. My parents never checked my homework so I never bothered to do it, and therefore never developed a sensible work ethic. 
Or: I was assigned to a bunch of additional courses after school, so I must be hella educated? Well, I never really had time to know what I like MYSELF, so when I got just a bit older I dropped every single of it, tired - never knew what was I supposed to do later, so I was just doing nothing, chronically. 
Such tiny things no one on earth would think of as bad? They grew into some huge fuck-ups. 

Now, I'm not saying my parents were evil. They were doing their best and they wanted the best for me and for the most part, they did great. But! such small things add a lot to the final picture when summed up.

 Sometimes it's not about your parents doing something, it's about them NOT doing this. While there is really no one to blame, it's not the point; what matters here is that you realize the reasons why you act in the certain ways, what are the roots of your habits and behaviors. To recognize these small things done when you were young and trace them to your adulthood, and actually FIX them.

Hope it was helpful:)

Update. The book itself has a separate chapter on discipline, but I would advise to read the whole thing, the chapters on emotions and childhood, self-soothing, etc, since the material is very educational(at least to me).

Update 2. There was another related book mentioned as eye-opening, *""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature parents""*. I haven't read it myself yet, but you may want to give it a shot as well!

Update 4. Damn guys, I low-key expected a lot of responses because of the intimate matters being concerned, but not this many! I'll just say that I'm very proud of each of you, for bothering to read it, for seeking answers even in the darkest of days, and for making it this far(in this post, or in life). This book or any other one may not be panacea, but I hope everybody will find something important in them that would allow to continue rocknrolling. Though the whole therapy and psychological analysis thing tends to be mocked and reduced to ""haha mommy didn't love you? man up"" nowadays(in my perception, at least), it shouldn't be brushed off blindly. No parent is perfect, if you feel hurt, then there is already a solid enough reason for it, and you should treat it carefully, even if you think you're just being weak, not trying enough etc. Okay, be weak! Be sensitive! I've been beating down emotions under the carpet not for so long comparing to other people, but it was enough for me to become severely depressed to the point of lying in bed for the whole day, unable to get up and get doing something(then I would blame myself for being lazy). Your feelings are already important enough! It's hard to stay disciplined(=to have a consistent routine and adopt good habits) when you don't know what you like/dislike, how do you feel about certain things, what do you think of yourself, etc. So stay tuned with them and be kind to yourself:)

**Questioning Motivation**

&nbsp;

If I have your attention, do me a favor.

&nbsp;

Think back to the last time you were motivated to do something. 

&nbsp;

It doesn’t matter what you were motivated for. It could have been to take the trash out. The point is to recall the last time you were putting *something* off, over and over again. Always promising yourself you’d get to it, just *later*. 

&nbsp;

- Finally going to the gym and eating healthier. 

- Finally taking school seriously and studying like you never had before. 

- Finally breaking your addiction to porn, cigarettes, alcohol, or food.

- Finally putting the time in to look for a job.

- Finally taking that step to becoming more social and extroverted.

- Finally taking the time to clean your apartment, bathroom, or room.

- Finally taking the initiative to wash all your clothes.

- Finally stepping up to take the trash out.

&nbsp;

Do you remember *why* you got so fired up? So motivated to finally make a change, take that action, make that jump? When before, all you did was put it off, promising yourself you’d start tomorrow. Do you know why you finally made the choice to say “No”, and get your ass moving?

&nbsp;

More importantly, do you ever wonder why you can’t get back to that point? You search and search for different motivational methods to get inspired enough to get back to that mindset you had once before. When nothing could take you off the path of success. When you felt invincible, as if someone finally woke you up to your purpose, and all was clear.

&nbsp;

That feeling is pretty elusive.

&nbsp;

For a lot of people, myself included, we only get those huge surges of motivation once every few months. When we’re forced to sit down and look at our life, and realize we aren’t where we want to be. We aren’t happy, we aren’t fulfilled. We’re in pain of our circumstances, and so desperately want to change, it hurts.

&nbsp;

Well;

&nbsp;

It wasn’t the combination of words from that speech you were listening to on YouTube. Though if we’re honest, those words were pretty inspiring and encouraging.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t that song you were listening and bumping to that did it either. Though, you’d love to hear that song again, just in case.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t the chapter in that self-help book you read and totally resonated with. Though, damn, you felt so understood, that surely had to be it?

&nbsp;

It wasn’t even that talk you had with that important person in your life. Though, you really should get together and talk with them again.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t any of those things. Not in themselves, at least. If it were, you’d feel that same rush of motivation, of drive, of fire, *every* time you heard that speech, listened to that song, read that book, spoke to that friend.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**The Secret**

&nbsp;

What got you motivated enough to take action, was your imagination.

&nbsp;

*”Oh God. This guys on some woohoo mystical bullshit.”*

&nbsp;

That’s a fair opinion to have. But for those of you that haven’t clicked away, do me another favor. If you can, try and remember what your thoughts looked like when you were deeply motivated. Not when you were promising yourself to do that thing, only to procrastinate until it was too late. Remember what your thoughts looked like just before you got highly driven, and finally took the actions towards improving. 

&nbsp;

The thoughts you had while listening to that speech. Listening to that song. Reading that book. Speaking with that friend. The words, lyrics, or beats themselves weren’t what motivated you. It was what you were envisioning in your head *while* doing those things. 

&nbsp;

- You thought about how unhappy you were with your current life.

- You thought about all the changes you wanted in your life.

- You thought about how much better your life could be.

- You thought about all the things holding you back.

- You thought about the steps you’d need to take to achieve that change.

&nbsp;

And more powerful than that, you imagined and envisioned in your head.

&nbsp;

- You imagined what your life looked like after you succeeded.

- You imagined how your friends and family would react.

- You imagined how you’d get all the girls/guys.

- You imagined how your lifestyle would change.

- You saw, in your imagination, the life you wanted. 

&nbsp;

**You were in your own head. Creating the motivation you needed, within yourself, by reflecting over your own emotions, feelings, and desires.**

&nbsp;

That’s why you have such a hard time getting motivated, and only seem to be truly driven and inspired once every couple of months. Because normally, you’re simply looking for a band aid. For a  quick fix solution, a new method you haven’t tried yet. Because while you know in the back of your mind you want more, you aren’t focused on it truly.

&nbsp;

It’s only during those deep dark periods, when something drastic happens to you. You get a notice from the doctor about your health, and your life is in danger. You run out of money, and don’t know if you’ll be able to pay bills this month. Your relationship is crumbling, and you fear you’ll never find someone to love you.  Nothing is going right for you, and life is constantly beating you down.

&nbsp;

You’re forced to look at your life. To reflect on all your past decisions. To truly weigh where your life is at. And you aren’t happy. You aren’t satisfied with your circumstances. You aren’t proud of what you reflect upon. You thought you’d have had more. Achieved more. Created more. Shared more. Expressed more. Lived more.

&nbsp;

It’s in these moments that we’re truly motivated to change. To finally take action towards our own improvement and development. 

&nbsp;

Not because of a speech, of a song, of a book, or a conversation. Not in themselves at least. It’s what they cause you to feel, to think, to imagine.
 
&nbsp;

Motivation only works when you anchor it with what you truly want for yourself. And not only that, but by then envisioning how your life can change, what your new lifestyle is like, and what steps you need tot take in order to achieve that success. Most importantly, motivation only works when you continuously reflect on those visions. If you only reflect once every few months, when you’re truly down and beaten, you’ll only feel that drive once every few months.

&nbsp;

However.

&nbsp;

If you fueled your soul with that passion and drive to succeed, each and every day, imagine how your entire life would change.

lgulvq,"You tell yourself *Ugh I have so much work to do today—there’s just no way I can squeeze in a workout…*

… you end up wasting hours scrolling through Reddit. Clearly a workout would have been fine.



You tell yourself *Ok, deadline in 8 hours. I just can’t believe how I could procrastinate so damn much—I had 2 weeks. I just need to sit my ass down, stop being an idiot, and just get this stupid thing done…*

*…* you proceed to somehow rationalize checking YouTube— \*just gotta get it out of my system —\*and by the time you resurface the deadline is now 4 hours away.



You tell yourself (after waking up cold in the middle of the night)… *I need to put on a t-shirt.*

… you proceed to put it on backwards. *Crap. Every time*.



What do all these scenarios have in common?

Well, for one, they’re all things I’ve done a thousand times over. Especially that last one. The odds are *supposed* to be 50/50, but I swear my record’s gotta be like 90/10 for getting it wrong.

More importantly, all of them could have been avoided. Not by being more motivated. Not by having more willpower or grit or determination. Not through a fancy method or an app. Not even by transforming into the better person you dream of being.

No. They could have been avoided *by going slower.*

Taking a moment to feel for the shirt tag takes time—it’s the slower way to go about putting on a shirt in the dark. But in the end, if you sum up all the minutes spent taking off, rotating and putting back on a shirt, you’d for sure conclude it’s actually the faster way.

Taking a minute to recoup after procrastinating on something; taking a second to allow for a little compassion and understanding, to exhale and remind yourself that you’re human and humans do illogical and short-sighted things; all that stuff burns a lot of time. So does going for a walk and returning to your desk without any inclination to force it; fully content with just sitting there mindfully observant of all the inner chaos; allowing the stress and panic and frustration and resistance do its thing; let it twirl around your mental space, then wash out.

Finally, not trying to cram an unrealistic amount of work in a day; taking the time for yourself and for your physical and mental wellbeing; that’s definitely the slow way at getting stuff done—but only if you make the assumption that \[productivity = butt in seat × number of hours\]. Yet, if you look at exercise and other positive lifestyle habits as an investment, one that slowly compounds returns in increased focus, creativity and those rarified *‘hey! I feel like working now!’* mental tokens to be redeemed the next time you sit at your desk, then you could argue that the slow way is really the fastest way to success.

…

So, if I could leave you with one lingering idea; one little proverb for you to pull out from your mental wallet whenever you catch yourself rushing through life, thinking *bah, I don’t need to check for that friggen shirt tag, it’ll be fine* —it would be this:

Go slow, to go fast.

If you want to go fast; if you want that desired outcome, your dream life, to arrive in the shortest time possible, the fastest way *is* the slowest way.

*Go slow… to go fast.*

Due time was at midnight, so I woke up early that morning, brushed my teeth, took a shower, made coffee etc., all while priming myself to get this assignment done. I opened my laptop and then… things didn’t get done.

&#x200B;

I spent hours dreading the work, looking at everything and nothing all over the internet, all to avoid getting started. Just one more video turned into a whole 8 hours of doing nothing productive at all. The stress and guilty feelings got worse and worse every passing minute. It got to the point where I started feeling physically ill. I was so overwhelmed and stressed that I just closed my eyes and tried to calm myself down. This wasn’t about the assignment anymore, I just needed to relax, or I was going to implode.

&#x200B;

I stopped thinking about the assignment. I stopped worrying about worrying. I just focused on relaxing. One thing at the time. And then when I opened my eyes, it all suddenly made sense. The pain of not doing my assignment was outweighing the pain of doing it. So I decided to just open my assignment and stare at it. I stared at it until I got bored (like a solid 2 minutes of just starting at a blank page on my computer screen). And then I just started typing.

&#x200B;

The assignment was done in (I kid you not) 3 hours. 3 hours. I spent 8+ hours making myself ill worrying about doing work for 3 hours. And I recall it wasn’t even painful to do, it was relatively easy actually. Ever since that day, whenever I procrastinate, I try to think of this moment. The pain I was feeling, it was real. I try to remember this one simple thing: The pain of not doing something outweighs the pain of doing it.

lfbg7z,"  When it comes to matters of discipline we tend to punish ourselves when we fall short of our goals. 

If we procrastinate on doing important work for what seems like the 100th time, we say,

*“Dam I’m such as lazy F\*\*\*.”*

When we skip our scheduled gym workout, we think,

*“No wonder I’m getting fat.”*

Our role models wake up at 4AM, run several businesses, and are in peak physical condition (all whilst having ideal social lives). 

Their seemingly perfect life reinforces our feelings of inadequacy.

*How can they figure it out while I stay stuck?* 

We treat ourselves like shit because we have never been taught otherwise.  

To us we see our lack of discipline as being an innate problem - not the result of an ineffective strategy. 

# The Truth 

Your lack of discipline is not a personal characteristic, it’s the result of several complex factors including:

* Upbringing (how your parents treated you growing up)
* Friends (their discipline level and standards affect your outlook)
* Your society (societal expectations and mass programming)
* Brain chemistry (we have different brains, duh!)

You did not choose the circumstances into which you were born, but you do have the power to transform yourself. 

# Discipline is fundamentally an awareness issue 

Whether you are trying to quit smoking but continue to light cigarettes, or you keep prioritising Netflix over important tasks – Your lack of discipline boils down to your lack of awareness.

If you do not possess the level of awareness needed to stop a destructive behaviour, you won’t be able to change your patterns.

Let me give you an analogy.

The difference between a good basketball player dunking hoops at your local court and a player in the NBA is their level of awareness as it pertains to the sport. 

Through practicing for thousands of hours the NBA player develops a mastery of the court. At the highest level, the professionals play from their subconscious minds.

What looks like calculated actions to us are more often automated reactions that have been created through deliberate work. 

Their brains pick up far more data than other players giving them a serious skill advantage. 

This is why you might physically be more capable than Michael Jordan but still lose to him 999 out of every 1000 games (you win a single game when MJ trips over a rock). 

# So now what?

To increase your level of awareness you need to study yourself like a scientist. 

Each time you find yourself engaging in a negative habit, pay attention to the thoughts and emotions that preceded the habit. 

Were you stressed?

Maybe you were bored or feeling disappointed?

Take note of this information (journals are good for this).

Also consider the feelings you had after your finished the habit. 

Did you feel a sense of relief? Or did you feel more energised? 

Every habit aims to fulfill a particular need. 

Only by becoming aware of this need can we start increasing our ability to be more disciplined.

Through analysing our actions we can start to find ways to overcome ineffective strategies.

As time progresses, you will find that you have more tools to deal with the negative habit.

Eventually, you will notice impulses rising way before you engage in the habit. 

Awareness is what gives you options, and with time your success will be automatic. 

# The Main Message 

If you have never played basketball before you wouldn’t expect to make it to the Olympics. You sure as hell wouldn’t beat yourself down for being a rookie. 

If you have not consciously worked on your discipline with the same gusto Einstein had when he was working on his relativity equations or Dave Chappelle when practicing his stand-up, then don’t beat yourself down when things don’t go your way. 

Be kind to yourself and focus on getting those hours in.

ipzwdd,"What if I told you that the next time you feel the urge to procrastinate or to grab that cookie, rather than dread or fear that feeling, to turn toward the experience with curiosity and really observe and get close and personal with what's actually happening in your body and mind that moment?

This mindfulness tactic may actually help you curb that craving the next time you face it.

I watched a talk on mindfulness by Dr. Brewer, a psychiatrist, and I wanted to share what I learned with you all because it has been helping me out a lot.

According to Brewer, being curious and exploring your habit engaging behavior actually helps you see what you get when you engage in that behavior and eventually, become disenchanted with your behavior.

Here is an example:

In one of Dr. Brewer's lab studies on smoking addiction, he had subjects (who had previously failed to quit smoking several times) focus on being curious about the experience of smoking, rather than forcing themselves to not smoke.

When one subject began smoking and truly tuned into what was happening in that process, she came to realize that smoking smelled like stinky cheese and tasted like chemicals- actually tasted like shit.

She had gone from knowing smoking was bad just in her head, to knowing it was bad for her viscerally in her bones.

And study results back up this example- **mindfulness actually turned out to be twice as effective at helping people quit smoking as gold standard therapy.**

So the next time you are hit with a craving, instead of looking for a way to make it go away, pay attention to how you are feeling both physically and emotionally in that moment, and continue to do so while you engage in your habit.

Perhaps you will then find joy in letting go of that behavior.

You dream of breaking through that pre-set mold: *get a job, play it safe, retire*.

It’s not just you.

You’re surrounded by similar people on this sub. Artists and creators and entrepreneurs. All vying for their chance to give their gift and make the world a better place.

>I want to write a novel, but never got every far. 

Setting ambitious goals is great, it’s indeed necessary if you want to grow and accomplish great things. And if it’s a little scary, that’s good. That means it’s out of your comfort zone. That means it’s worthwhile and has the potential for real impact.

But, there’s an issue. ***When it comes to execution, to actually reaching that goal;*** ***at best we procrastinate to no end, and at worst, things fall completely apart and we quit.***

Big goals invariably create a bigger problem.

They lead to you being pummeled with overwhelm. Staring at a giant wall to climb, you can’t help but feel intimidated, behind and discouraged.

Still. We try to shake off the feeling. We put it in a box. We look at the ones who’ve made and try to replicate their steps. *Want 100k subscribers to your channel? Post, post, post and post some more. Don’t stop. I too was once a nobody.*

But the emotions can be paralyzing. Poring your heart and soul into something then allowing yourself to be vulnerable to criticism, or worst, to crickets—it's not easy.  It’s no joke when things don’t go as well as you hoped. It's take a lot of stamina to persevere.

In the end it’s not the haters out there that’ll get you to quit; if only it was that easy. No. It’s the little goblins inside your own head, taunting you with *you're good enough* until you finally give up.

…

So, TLDR of the above is: it’s great to say “*I’m aiming for the stars!!”,* yet when you barely clear a tree stump after jumping as hard as you can, it can be crushing to your moral.

You need a way to get there. Not a shortcut (doesn’t exist). Not a boost (inspiration is overrated). But a *way.* A method.

**I call it logarithmic goal setting—or log goals for short.**

When it comes to achieving goals, the conventional advice is to chunk it down. Mince it up into a long list of workable and repeatable tasks and objectives.

Big goals will provide for you a vision and direction. They provide you with a North Star.

This is good but it’s not enough. It would be like going for a hike using only a compass to B line it directly to the summit. You’re gunna hit a tree or fall off a cliff at some point. You also need a map and a physical path to follow.

The idea of log goals is to first **break your goals into levels of difficulty and complexity. Then figure out the list of tasks,** ***but only for the first level.***

This works best with quantifiable goals (‘lose 100 pounds’, versus ‘lose weight’).

Losing 100 pounds is crazy intimidating. To achieve that you’d nee to ???? buy some books? hire a trainer? clear your pantry? buy only kale and—\*checks blog—\*quinoa? Post a crazy vow to Facebook??

It’s OK to *want* to lose 100 pounds, for that to be the end goal, but to start off, instead ask yourself, **how do I lose 1 pound?** This where you’re at: Level 1.

Figure out how to beat Level 1. Ignore the rest.

Once that’s done (and you have that first bit of momentum), you’ll be at Level 2. When you get there—and again not a minute sooner—ask yourself *how do I beat Level 2*? Which can be to go from 1→10 pounds lost.

Level 2 is a notch up in difficulty and complexity. But by then you’ll have gathered some lessons, skills, confidence, slightly better eating habits, etc.

Once you beat Level 2, which may take a while, then you could take on the final boss: 10→100 lbs. Level 3 is hardest of them all, but, in keeping with a video-game analogy, by then your character strength will be increased, and her inventory would be filled with items to use when confronting the final boss.

…

Let’s go through this again, but with an example from above: making it as a musician.

As you know, that goal is too vague, so start by breaking it down into measurable sub-goals. Get to 250 000 Spotify listeners. Reach 10 000 Instagram follower. Make 2000$ per month in income.

Let’s focus on the first sub-goal (250K Spotify listeners) but the process can be repeated for the other two.

**Step 1:** decide on how many levels this game will have. You can count the number of 0s if it's a multiple of 10 (so 10 000 would be 4), or just go with 5, which is what I do.

**Step 2:** Map out the metrics for the various levels. The idea is to go with some sort of exponential growth. You can do this roughly. Start with 1, then 10, then maybe 150 and continue until you get to the final goal.

If you like math, you can use the formula F = G^({1/L})

Where:

* F = a growth factor
* G = the final big goal (so 250 000)
* L = number of levels (so 5)

For this example, plugging the variables into a calculator, we get F = 12.011. So the series would go 12, 144, 1732, 20812, 250 000. You could use the numbers as is, but I usually round it up. I'd go with :

Level 1: 0 → 10

Level 2: 10 → 150

Level 3: 150 → 2000

Level 4: 2000 → 25 000

Level 5: 25 000 → 250 000

**Step 3:** Figure out level 1.

Forget about the rest—that’ll come when you ‘graduate’ to each next level.

It’s ok to have no fricking idea how to get 250 000 Spotify listeners. But, you *can* figure out what to do to get 10 music lovers eager to listen to your stuff and subscribe.

Brainstorm. Consult that how-to-make-it guide you bought. Write out a plan.

The fact the goal is now mini should clear things up for you in terms of activities. Do you need an intricate website? No. Do you need to find a music agent? No. Do you need to buy a 5000$ microphone? No. Do you need to get better at what you do? Well yeah, but not ""100k screaming fans"" good—you need ""10 hipster 'I liked her before she got big' fans"" good.

That’s doable.

So yeah, will it involve work? Stepping out of your comfort zone? Yes and yes; that was always going to be the case, but I hope you can see that this objective is far less intimidating.

You can start here on Reddit, posting your stuff, writing commentary on music subs, starting up a few DMs with people. You’re looking to connect with just 10 ‘fans’, which could include other budding musicians and audiophiles. There isn't all that much pressure here.

**Step 4:** Execute on that plan until you finish level 1. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as best you can. It might take a while and that's fine.

**Step 5:** Repeat this process for level 2 (10 → 150).

Ok, this is getting a bit more tricky. But, by then again, you’ll have collected some items to use on your quest.

Some collected items are hard: 10 people that have agreed to post your stuff on social media. Insightful and clear advice gleened from someone already in level 3. A sweet website you discovered that helps people find new musicians.

Some items are soft: budding confidence. Little dose of validation and encouragement to go on. New skills you developed and some lessons learned from small success and failures.

With all of that, brainstorm your options then formulate a new plan for Level 2. This could involve similar action items as Level 1 like practicing your craft and contributing to several subreddits, but you can pivot some of your focus and efforts elsewhere. Perhaps it’s time to focus more on Instagram? Maybe you it's time to buy some better gear?

**Step 6:** Execute on that plan until you pass Level 2.

**Step 7 :** Repeat the whole process for Level 3: 150 → 2000

Keep expanding. By then it might be time to start reaching out to blogs or industry influencers.

You can take this on with a ‘trading-up’ mentality: approach and work with small bloggers/influencers... then approach someone a bit bigger using your previous interactions and collaborations as social proof; repeating until you reach trade-up to some of the bigger players…

**Step 8:** Then do the same for Level 4: 2000 → 25 000

At this point, I'm out of advice because frankly I have no clue how one would make that leap. But that's ok. The point is not to have everything mapped from now to when you're headlining at Madison Square Garden.

All you need to have figured out is how to beat whichever level you're on.

**Step 9:** Then get to the final level. Level 5, aka the big leagues: 25 000 → 250 000.

You got this.

7xzy1f,"WOT/Stream of consciousness warning:

All right, so let's start with some context. Way back in 2008 I was like many young men entering their 20s: An underachiever who finally realized he had to take some steps if he wanted to attain the life he wished. Like many young men, I developed an addiction to self-improvement. My first ""hit"" was reading ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss and chasing the idea of becoming the best version of myself. Although I never became the master PUA I wanted to be at the start, I managed to make several drastic changes to my life: I dropped from over 20% bodyfat to under 10% and built a fair amount of muscle, I changed my grades from mediocre (High School) to absolute top notch (University), I managed to stop smoking and cut out some other addictions, I developed a very rigid sleep schedule, and pretty much everything in my life went the way I wanted it to. More importantly: I was extremely disciplined. If I wanted to do something, I would outline a plan and follow it rigorously. In my mind, this was obvious, and I would tell others seeking advice to ""Just fucking do it"". 

However, due to circumstances outside of my control, my progress in my study program was halted, and I spent an entire semester with no clear purpose or idea of where my future was going. I did not know so at the time, but during this semester, I somehow lost my trait of discipline. My habits stuck with me - I got through my master's with honors, and I kept on working out, but It slowly dawned on me that I had serious trouble with applying change to my life.

So, for the next six years or so, I felt that something extremely important was missing from my life. I had this vision of the person I wanted to be, yet I wasn't moving in the right direction. I started feeling guilty about all the time I wasted, and I would periodically (maybe every three months) sit down and write down goals for a set period, week plans etc. I would read about some method online and set out a detailed plan to follow it. And every time, the same thing would happen: I would fail. Every single actual change I wanted, I would fail at. I wanted to get better at running (in contrast to lifting), so I set up a program for it. After a few weeks I realized I wasn't following the program at all. I would come up with an excuse or procrastinate. Every familiar area however, would be no problem at all. I could set up detailed plans and follow them. As this repeated again and I again I started believing that something was seriously wrong with me. Was I doomed to never return to my glory days of discipline?

Then a realization hit me - for the first time in a long, long time. Of course I wasn't getting disciplined - because none of what I was doing actually had anything to do with discipline. 

I remembered a professor from my master's who told us about a study he had conducted on Norwegian top skiing athletes. The goal of the study was to see what separated the winning skiers from the mediocre ones. To everyone's surprise, the answer had been quite simple: The top skiers actually followed the training programs and diets they were told to follow. 

I had everything backwards: Plans, programs, and schedules don't give you discipline - they require it. 

Plans and programs are excellent tools in order to achieve results if you can follow them. But in my case, I realized they were a part of an increasingly vicious circle. This circle went something like this: 

I feel bad about myself not living up to my potential and wasting time. 
I decide to do something about it.
I come up with some method or plan, and typically make goals and schedules for the next week. I spend a lot of time visualizing where I want to be. 
I become motivated and determined, and the anxiety/shame/whatever I feel is gone. I feel like I have accomplished something. I feel like I finally will realize it, this is it. 
I fail to follow said plan
Feelings of shame and failure show up
I distract myself with video games, socialization, or some other activity. 
Repeat 

I suddenly realized why this was happening, and what it actually meant that I lacked discipline. When I felt bad about wasting time - this was my brain's way of telling me that there are problems I need to attend to. Decisions I need to make. Instead of attending the problems however, I engaged in what could only be described as an advanced form of daydreaming. By designing a schedule and thinking about my goals, I created an illusion of myself as being productive that was so powerful that I would trigger the reward system in my brain. This made me feel like I accomplished something, although I actually had not. 

So why did I not follow up? Because I made plans that assumed that somehow, through sheer force of will, I would be someone else tomorrow, and would be able to motivate myself to commit to a long list of tasks. I somehow imagined that tomorrow I would have more willpower than today. But I never did. If I decided to wake up at 6 in the morning - that cost me a lot of willpower! This meant that whatever else I was planning that day was way less likely to occur. And not only that - I had wasted my motivational energy the day before on planning. My imagination had been so vivid that my brain decided to stop handing out motivational energy. 

Not only did my planning sap my motivation - it created a false sense of ""who I really was"" - what my potential was, that haunted me from day to day. Thinking up various daily routines I could follow and how that would make me into a superhuman somehow made me shameful for not doing all of that. And this again made the temptation for distraction more and more powerful. 

In this way, schedules, planning and motivation became just another form of escape. Just another drug for my brain. 

And I finally realized what discipline actually is: It is the ability to recognize anxiety/shame/whatever as a signal from the brain that there is a problem that needs your attention, and immediately go about solving it. It is about recognizing your brain telling you to seek distraction, and paying attention to what is actually happening. What are you telling yourself? What reason are you giving yourself to procrastinate? Can you override it a bit this time? If you do, it will be easier next time. And if you do it enough, you'll start being someone who takes action immediately. 

My biggest reason for procrastination is that I constantly worked out problems in an imaginary, predictable future. I didn't attend what was right in front of me. I made schedules, plans and goals that were motivating to fantasize about, but that actually intensified my shame and anxiety every time I failed to realize them, prompting me to distract myself. 

One important realization that I made was that many of my goals and dreams were false. They exist in a fantasy world based on fantasy ideas about what makes me happy, and what is meaningful. The truth is that I don't know my SMART goals for something I've never done. I don't know anything. I only know that I have a gut feeling that tells me I want to try out something vaguely defined. And that's ok! That's all I need. The future doesn't exist. The only time I can take action is right now. I can't fail, because I have no idea what constitutes success. I only learn this by doing something.

It's actually terribly obvious. When I play video games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, I don't sit down and schedule my day in order to achieve a certain armor or weapon. Still, I work extremely systematically. It appears organically. 

This is what discipline is. Listening to yourself and acting in line with what you want right here and now. 


So does this work? So far, yes. I take action more often, I've done things recently that I've put off for years due to some vague idea that I need to plan how to do it. Turns out I just needed to get started. Not only that, but I'm a lot more content these days. I no longer have the same feeling in my gut of impending failure, or some sort of time pressure to live up to whatever standards I set. I still make plans and use methods - but I use these to solve problems I've already initiated working on, where there's some momentum.

hchyfi,"It is making a spreadsheet of your debt and enforcing a morning routine and cooking yourself healthy meals and no longer just running from your problems and calling the distraction a solution.

It is often doing the ugliest thing that you have to do, like sweat through another workout or tell a toxic friend you don’t want to see them anymore or get a second job so you can have a savings account or figure out a way to accept yourself so that you’re not constantly exhausted from trying to be everything, all the time and then needing to take deliberate, mandated breaks from living to do basic things like drop some oil into a bath and read Marie Claire and turn your phone off for the day.

A world in which self-care has to be such a trendy topic is a world that is sick. Self-care should not be something we resort to because we are so absolutely exhausted that we need some reprieve from our own relentless internal pressure.

True self-care is not salt baths and chocolate cake, it is making the choice to build a life you don’t need to regularly escape from.

And that often takes doing the thing you least want to do.

It often means looking your failures and disappointments square in the eye and re-strategizing. It is not satiating your immediate desires. It is letting go. It is choosing new. It is disappointing some people. It is making sacrifices for others. It is living a way that other people won’t, so maybe you can live in a way that other people can’t.

It is letting yourself be normal. Regular. Unexceptional. It is sometimes having a dirty kitchen and deciding your ultimate goal in life isn’t going to be having abs and keeping up with your fake friends. It is deciding how much of your anxiety comes from not actualizing your latent potential, and how much comes from the way you were being trained to think before you even knew what was happening.

If you find yourself having to regularly indulge in consumer self-care, it’s because you are disconnected from actual self-care, which has very little to do with “treating yourself” and a whole lot do with parenting yourself and making choices for your long-term wellness.

It is no longer using your hectic and unreasonable life as justification for self-sabotage in the form of liquor and procrastination. It is learning how to stop trying to “fix yourself” and start trying to take care of yourself… and maybe finding that taking care lovingly attends to a lot of the problems you were trying to fix in the first place.

It means being the hero of your life, not the victim. It means rewiring what you have until your everyday life isn’t something you need therapy to recover from. It is no longer choosing a life that looks good over a life that feels good. It is giving the hell up on some goals so you can care about others. It is being honest even if that means you aren’t universally liked. It is meeting your own needs so you aren’t anxious and dependent on other people.

dw13td,"I am an attorney and am 32-years-old. I struggled waking up on-time my whole life. I was always envious of early-bird personalities but as hard as I tried I never was able to be one. If my alarm is by my bed (whether it is my phone or a traditional alarm) I will almost certainly hit snooze and sleep in even on important days. The best I was ever able to accomplish was setting multiple alarms on the other side of the room, but even then it was a 50/50 chance that I would actually get up. If I had an important test or appointment I had to get up for I would have to psych myself up the night before, set multiple alarms, and drink a bunch of water to ensure I would get up on time.

A couple months ago I read Atomic Habits and discovered (learned?) a trick that has worked wonders for me. This is NOT an advertisement for Atomic Habits. But the truth is I did learn this trick from that book and I should give credit where credit is due.

In reading the book I realized that when I wake up in the morning I have no plan other than a vague, ambiguous self-directive to ""stay awake"" or ""start getting ready."" Even though the amount of effort required to choose what I should do next after hitting the alarm was minuscule, it still required more energy than I could muster when I was half-awake in the morning so I would give up and crawl back in bed. I didn't consciously realize this is what was happening until I read Atomic Habits. I then realized I needed to have a clear, very simple and repeatable plan (i.e., a habit) for what I would do *after* I turned off my alarm in the morning. If I planned a follow-up action in advance and did it habitually, waking up would become easier for me. That was the hypothesis, and I'm proud to report that nearly three months later I have woken up 100% of the time, on-time, when I have followed this method.

**The Toilet Method**

I set an alarm (like this one [here](https://www.amazon.com/Peakeep-Battery-Operated-Ticking-Ascending/dp/B073VFBN34/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=basic+analog+alarm+clock&qid=1573688709&sr=8-14) on Amazon) and put it in the bathroom. (I only do this on evenings where I am committed to waking up on time the next morning. If it is a weekend and I would like to sleep in the next morning, I decide the night before that I will not be following this method.) I then remind myself when I set the alarm that in the morning, when the alarm goes off, I will sit on the toilet and pee. After I pee, I will wash my hands. After I was my hands, I will brush my teeth. After I brush my teeth, I will shave. After I shave, I will wash my face. In Atomic Habits, this is referred to as Habit Chaining (which, as the author mentions, is a general concept and not something that he created).

Trigger: Alarm goes off

1. Toilet
2. Hands
3. Teeth
4. Shave
5. Face

By determining exactly what I would do after I hit the alarm in the morning, I removed the need to think and decide in that moment what I would do next after the alarm. Now, when I hit the alarm, I already know what the next step is. I even tell myself that after I do Toilet, Hands, Teeth, Shave, and Face, that I can get back into bed if I am still tired, but I say that because in the five minutes it takes me to do this small routine -- especially by the time I have washed my face with cold water in Step 5 -- I am now awake enough to the point that I am thinking clearly and it is easy for me to find the will power to stay out of bed. So far, nearly three months later, I have been successful 100% of the time that I have followed this method.

This may seem like REALLY basic stuff to people here, but I am 32-years-old and still had not yet figured it out. For the first time in my life, I have confidence that I can wake up whenever I choose. There have even been several occasions that I have needed to wake up very early (4:30 a.m.) and this method has worked great.

**TL:DR** *- Struggled forever to wake up to my alarm clock. Bought a basic analog alarm and put it in my bathroom. Predetermined that when the alarm would go off in the morning that I would sit on the toilet. After using the toilet, I would wash my hands, brush my teeth, shave my face, and wash my face (in that order). In other words, the key for me learning how to wake up to an alarm clock was predetermining what I would do after I turned off the alarm clock (i.e., sit on the toilet), which would ""chain"" into a few other morning activities.*",r/getdisciplined,[Method] I have struggled waking up early / on-time my whole life.

c3w405,"Hello Reddit,

I made this account just to post this. 
First of all, my life 2 years ago: 

19 years old, smoking weed almost daily, failing college, overweight, depressed, social anxiety, didn’t care about myself. Had a nice group of friends who were all the same as me (depressed, lazy, unmotivated). I’d skip class every day to just sit around and play videogames and smoke weed or get drunk. I lived at home with my mom. She enabled everything and did everything for me, including all my finances, cleaned my room, made me food etc. I was a 19 year old baby. Didn’t work out, ate junk 24/7, slept 12+ hours a night, neglected everything in life including personal hygiene. I also was a complete pushover and would do anything to please others. 

Don’t know what triggered it, but i suddenly came to the realization that i can’t and don’t want to live this way anymore. I was completely miserable and used weed/alcohol/videogames to numb myself from reality. I failed college and dropped out, doing nothing with my life at this point. 

In the past 2 years i have changed from a lazy, fat, unmotivated and unhappy guy to a motivated and happy guy. Im currently 21 years old (turned 21 this year). Right now i:


- Quit smoking weed and completely stopped drinking alcohol. Over a year sober from both.

- Work out 5 times a week, lifting weights and cardio every day. Usually in the gym for a little under 2 hours. I lost about 20 pounds and am now in the best shape of my life (a REAL sixpack instead of beer) 

- Work a basic retail job monday - friday 6 hours/day. This really helped me become more extroverted and talking to people is very easy now, i’d recommend this to everyone with poor social skills. 

- Saved a lot of money, spend as little as i can. Currently only pay for my phone, getting a haircut, the gym and sometimes a new piece of clothing/shoes. 

- Worked on my confidence and am now not afraid to say no anymore or go after what i want. (Biggest improvement for me). Retail job helped with this A LOT. 

- Fixed my sleep schedule. I go to bed at 11, fall asleep around 12 and wake up at 8 every day, including weekends. I walk our family dog for an hour first thing in the morning (about 2.5 miles). 

- Started taking care of myself. Shave, shower, use deodorant, fix my nails, brush my teeth morning &amp;amp; before bed, regularly get a hair cut and get my eyebrows fixed (excess hair) 

- Started reading every night to keep my focus on the right things. I read about finance, health, fitness etc. Anything i can learn from. I really enjoy doing this thus its easy for me, i wouldn’t recommend doing this if you don’t like it. 

- Im currently doing research on what i want to study in college next year. I’ll be attending college again in 2020. I have about a year and 3 months left till then. 

All of this sounds great doesn’t it? Yeah, it is. However, after making all these changes i lost all of my friends. They don’t like me anymore and don’t want to be around me anymore. They are still the same way they were 2 years ago so its definitely for the best but it still sucks. I also lost contact with multiple family members who i found out basically hated me for no reason and talked shit about me to others. All for the best, but the problem i have right now is i don’t have any friends anymore and i don’t have anyone to talk to or hang out with besides my mom and my siblings which gets old quickly.

The town i live in is small and everyone knows eachother, it feels kind of suffocating to be honest. Im not interested in being friends with the people around here anymore as they are all pretty much the same way i used to be in the past. They party a lot and i don’t want that lifestyle anymore. I still have 15 months left till i move a few hours away for college and i don’t know what to do in the meantime. 

What i usually do in my free time now is: gym, read, listen to music, watch tv, go for long walks with our dog, go for a run, walk around town and ‘shop’ (look at cool stuff without buying it haha). And chill in our garden to work on my tan. Its ok, but lonely. 

Oh i will also be getting my drivers license this year, starting lessons in 5 weeks! 

So, any advice is welcome. What are things to do while i wait for college to start?",r/getdisciplined,"[Advice] Did a 180 in life, lost all my friends and some family members.",2027,
lv72bb,"To be honest, I am the laziest person I know. But the thing I discovered about myself is that I love when I get in the zone and do what I'm supposed to do. That might be studying, working out, running a 5k, starting business, quitting bad habits and making good ones etc. And I haven't figured out why the hell I procrastinate so much. But now it makes sense.

In my opinion, the reason we all procrastinate is because it's **HARD TO START**.

When I studied for exams, the hardest thing was to organize myself and what will I start working on first. Eventually I would get ""in the zone"" and studying would become very satisfying, because that's what I am supposed to do and it will benefit me on long-term. Us people want instant gratification, for example watching Netflix instead of studying for exam.

From now on I challenge myself first, and yourself too, to do next:

*I don't care if you need to hit that morning workout, or start studying for exam, do the laundry, approach that girl/guy,* ***just start doing it***. *If you want to workout in the morning, sleep in your workout clothes and get that workout as soon as possible before your brain starts to play with you and makes excuses. When you see that cute girl, count to 5, approach her and introduce yourself before you overthink and start making excuses. She might even be your future wife, we never know what could happen.*

In my opinion, **the most important thing is to start**, because in my experience **movement** creates **motivation.**

tfifk3,"TL;DR: Get the gist by scanning and reading the bold text.

**We all have in our imagination this perfect, idealized version of ourselves. It’s where we’ve finally “fixed” ourselves**; where we’ve become able to practice monk-like levels self-discipline and self-control.

In desperation, we keep turning over every rock of self-help and productivity advice, expecting that *one day* we will come across the perfect method that will “fix” us permanently.

Sometimes you find something promising: a shiny new book recommended on Reddit. It’s great and works… for a short while anyway, until you slip or deviate a little, then a lot, then everything comes crashing down in a fiery blaze of self-contempt.

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to better yourself, but you need to understand that **self-help methods and techniques are “Step 2” of the solution. They won’t ever stick—you’ll forever be stuck in a ""one-step forward, two-steps back” rut—if you don’t start with “Step 1”.**

**Whether you can one day become the idealized version of yourself is a big unknown**—I’m closer today yet nowhere near perfect—**but one thing is categorically certain: there will be a transition period**.

During this transition period you will slip, falter, and come-up-short on your commitments. It's inevitable. **Step 1 is about learning to better react and respond to the consequences of not being perfect.**

Why is Step 1 this not just important, but altogether essential?

**Because much of your “bad” behaviour**—your distractibility, your compulsions to grab at your vices always with a neat and rational excuse—**stems from a feedback loop that is triggered by the slightest imperfection:**

>**You indulge in a vice with a rational excuse** (*lemme go on Tik Tok for 5 mins, get it out of my system so I can focus*)

So what’s the solution?

**We’ve all heard the expression of “sweeping things under the rug.”** It’s where one focuses on the result or consequences of a problem without addressing the core cause to prevent it from happening in the first place.

**Well, there’s no expression for the reverse of that, but that’s exactly what you’re doing.** You’re adamantly obsessed with finding a core cause and cure for all your problems; you’re seeking prevention… while **you’re neglecting to take care of all the mess on the floor.**

Even if you find the most spectacular “Step 2” solution, some mess will still fall as you transition. You won’t be perfect, not right away, not for a long while, maybe not ever. And it’s the mess that’s triggering much of your problem. The mess is what sets you off on these feedback loops of vice that end in wasted days, binges and what always feels like you returning to where you started, but worst.

It doesn’t have to be that way.

We’re lucky. **Us humans have access to a giant rug that can contain a thousand lifetimes of messy spills, fuck-ups, embarrassments, irrational behaviors, bad habits and binges.**

**It’s called self-compassion.**

With self-compassion, you can sweep away your *past* failings. You can come to understand yourself and see how all your past “failings” were done as an understandable coping mechanisms for the pain, stress or worry you’re constantly feeling.

You *deserve* to forgive yourself. You *deserve* to accept and love yourself as you are now, today. If I can’t convince you of this, I promise you that any therapist worth their salt will.

More importantly though, **with self-compassion you can sweep away your** ***present*** **slip-ups, as they happen in real-time and shortly after**. **You can come to accept and anticipate being imperfect, so when it happens you can shrug and move on fast. You don't have to 'start-over' each time.**

…

You, like me, will act in frenetic and impulsive ways. It is what it is. The brain does what it does.

This doesn’t mean that you are morally flawed, broken, sickly or have a bad character. We’re just wired differently, and that’s OK.

We might excel in ways that the kid you see memorizing textbooks for hours doesn’t. He can be focused and still; yet he’s about as creative, expressive and interesting as a microwave-oven. He can *memorize* ideas… but ask him to come up with new and clever ones and he’ll fail.

But not you. You have ideas running through you like busy tadpoles in a stream. They’re slippy and hard to catch, but they’re there. They’re bountiful.

You’re not better, just different. It just so happens that our society—with its report cards and entrance exams and performance reviews—tends to favor the focused kid. But that’s not a hard rule; the exceptions are the ones that actually create beautiful things and drive change in our world\*.

**If you get out of your own way with your self-criticism and learn to accept, anticipate, forgive, and shrug-off your inevitable failures, you too can become amazingly productive and creative**.

You’ll manage to stay on whatever “Step 2” path you choose (see for the one I’m on), because when you inevitably deviate, you can find your way back.

…

I see you. Like you’re in a mirror that projects myself 5 years or so in the past, I see you clearly.

From my side, I can see you scrambling to fix what’s causing the mess of your life. I can see you berating yourself for getting side-tracked from your work 15 minutes ago.

I can also feel what you feel: the pain and regret for being so behind as an adult; the stress of a million obligations and pressures and worries; the frustration from also being incomprehensibly juvenile and impulsive when it comes to vices.

I see you telling yourself, *I just gotta fix this! I gotta fix me.*

But there’s a mess on the floor. It’s causing a lot of your pain and an uncontrollable compulsion to pacify this pain with your reliable vices... which leads to more of a mess and more vice.

You can sweep all that under the giant rug of self-compassion.

Just when you finish, be sure to keep that broom handy. You’re going to need it.

kwh2ej,"Have you ever stopped to question why when, say there’s a big bag of chips open in the kitchen pantry, you find yourself repeatedly moseying over on autopilot? Have you ever *really* questioned that behavior? Gotten down to the root cause?

We tend to joke about such a things. *“I literally have zero self-control or willpower; if there’s a bag of chips open, I’ll kill it in a day despite any promise I made to ration it for the week.”*

Fine, so you avoid buying family-sized bags of chips—*gotta just stick to the dang perimeter when I shop at the grocery store*—but what about all your other vices which can’t be so easily avoided? This is where things get less jokey as a workable solution evades us.

Let's get back to the original question. When we procrastinate; when we waste hours and hours on Reddit or YouTube despite knowing we’re screwing ourselves over, what do we tell ourselves? What do assume is the root cause of our dreadfully lousy actions?

It’s all on us. It's on our lack of self-control and self-discipline. It's on our non-existing motivation and drive. We have some deficiency—we’re somehow broken, lacking some basic inner quality that seemingly every other functional human was born with.

I wish I could tell you it’s not your fault, because it is. Actually, that’s only half correct because *here is the biggest life truth that—once internalized, once applied—changes everything.*

**Unbeknownst to you, the concept of 'you', who ‘you’ are, is comprised of two separate entities.**

First, there’s the Physical self. It's composed of your body and it's spongy brain kept safe and warm in a hard skull. This organ, with it’s neuro-wiring and billions of chemical squirting cells, works to influence your behavior with the sole purpose of you surviving and hopefully replicating.

And there’s the Observing Self; the ‘you’ that doesn’t exist with a physical dimension, but who can, nonetheless, observe.

I feel like I’m about to lose you, so let’s use an example. It’ll seem ridiculous at first, but it’ll make it crystal clear what the heck I’m talking about. And this ain’t a philosophical lecture, so straight after we'll get to where this gets *practical*; where and how this can be applied to yield self-discipline.

Ok. I want you to say out loud (or whisper) the phrase: “there is a goat in the yard”.

Repeat it a few times… *there is a goat in the yard,* *there is a goat in the yard,* *there is a goat in the yard…*

Now, stop saying out loud, but keep repeating it in your head… *there is a goat in the yard, there is a goat in the yard, there is a goat in the yard…*

Keep going. See if you can observe those words. ‘Look’ at them, point your attention to it as if there was a Bluetooth speaker behind you harping out those same words on loop.

Boom. That right there was the two parts of ‘you’ at play. The Physical Self was physically active, as in millions of neurons were fired so that those mental ‘sounds’ could be made. There’s nothing spiritual or metaphysical about this; a scientist could have probed your brain and mapped out the exact sequence of events that were needed to produce that thought.

The 'you' observing all that, the thing removed from it, witnessing the mental sound, *that was the Observing Self.*

Here’s the kicker. **The Physical Self is, and only is, responsible for all your ‘willpower failings’. Not the real you, not the Observing Self.**

You see, the Physical Self... is an idiot. It still thinks it's the year negative 72 000. It still thinks we're all somewhere in the wild Savanna's of Africa where food is *extremely* scarce and threats are coming at you from every angle. So the Physical Self does stuff—literally, it secrets chemicals like dopamine—all with the intent to help you survive in a world we've long ago abandoned.

For example, you eat tasty chips on autopilot because they contain carbohydrate. Where/when the brain evolved, carbs were ridiculously rare and available temporarily (fruiting plants are seasonal). So when you taste some, it triggers an alarm that announces, “Hey! It’s harvest time!! Go go go! Eat as much as possible before the source dries up; more than we need right now so that we can store the excess glucose in some fat cells to have a chance at making it through the long, cold winter.” But the winter never comes. There never was a reason for us to evolve a stopping mechanism; so when our species was thrown into a new era of abundant and cheap starchy foods, the obesity epidemic was the inevitable outcome.

Then there's social media. You peruse social media on autopilot because by thumbing through images of people displaying their fabulous lifestyles, your brain associates yourselves with them. It doesn’t know what a ‘screen’ is, it just takes in visual data and thinks you are there with them; like you are part of their entourage. And being part of an in-group of high status people would be awesome for survival, so we evolved to crave and seek more of it constantly. The brain doesn’t know it’s all fake; that it’s all vicarious.

The same thing goes for porn. I could go on with countless examples but the point I'm making is that all your irrational behavior; all your rationalizing, procrastination and binging; all these things are orchestrated by the Physical Self doing what it thinks it's supposed to do.

But we forget that. Or we don't want to hear it. Instead we blame the core of ourselves, we blame the Observing Self.

...

So we all have some ridiculously outdated wiring aiming at influencing out behavior, thinking it's ensuring our survival, when really it's making us sick and miserable. So how do we get it to stop?

There is nothing we can do directly to make it stop. But we can give it *space*. As Steven Covey writes:

>“Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

This is how I work that quote in my day to day life:

At some point in my day I'll get a craving or an impulse to check Reddit. When that happens, I stop. I sit there and I do what I can to just observe the impulse. I *there is a goat in my yard* the shit out of it until I'm completely detached and just watching it without judgement. Next, with the 10 000 watt lightbulb of awareness, I scrutinize it and question it from every angle.

99 times out of 100, I end up easily rejecting it. I know too much. I know where these impulses are coming from. I know it's just faulty programming, so I just don't trust it. I almost never trust these impulses. I hear the rationalizations and excuses and I call them lies. Manipulations. Trickery.

To be clear, sometimes I forget. Sometimes I still act on impulse. Literally, as I write this, not a couple hours ago I was scrolling through Reddit rather than paying attention at a work meeting. Autopilot is still autopilot and in that periods I was mindless, as in my Observing Self was dissolved into the experience. It happens.

But still, when I catch myself, it's becoming more and more of a habit to detach and take a step back (and I have set up numerous reminders to 'plug into the present moment'). I am able to be compassionate with myself when I falter; to remind myself that I have a brain that simply evolved for a totally different environment, so it did what it was supposed to do (but it's still an idiot).

I can even step back and away from the negative emotions that swells when I falter, and still, I do my best not to identify with all that. I look at those emotions and I say, *ah, there it is… the feeling of stress and regret for procrastinating. Thanks ol’ brain for secreting all that cortisol like a sabretooth tiger is behind me, but it’s actually not needed*. And I wait until it all dissipates. And it always dissipates.

So again:

One hour later I realized how little I actually know. Relatively basic questions had me stumbling around like a fool.

It was easily the most embarrassing moment of my life. My interviewer, Seth, was straight with me. He told me immediately that I wasn't going to get the job.

kq9imw,"It was 8:00 am on January 2nd. The holiday festivities were donezo and so was the period of easy excuses to sleep in, and be an all-around lazy blob.

Your New Years resolution was crystal clear: Spend \[some reasonable number of hours\] everyday doing \[a repeatable task\] towards \[an ambitious goal\]. Good. Great. Awesome.

So it was time, not just to talk about these promises, but to execute. To do. So here's how it went that morning:

*Computer is booted up, time wasting site blocker is activated, Word is loaded and good to go. Check.*

*Piping hot coffee at arms reach. Check.*

*Desktop is clean and tidy, che—no wait the stapler is crooked. Ok, there—heck.*

*Let’s do this thi—aaaaaaaaaand holy hell…. uugh… I. just. don’t. feel. like. it. I legit don’t fricking feel like it. What the actual hell…. !! Every time. Why?!*

\*Proceeds to dick around on Reddit instead of work\*

*…*

Sound familiar?

This, amigo, is called Resistance. That overwhelming-repulsion-to-work-that-makes-it-seem-like-the-task-at-hand-is-a-worse-idea-than-licking-the-damp-inside-corner-of-a-bus-shelter-while-setting-it-aside-to-browse-through-r /memes-the-absolute-best-idea-ever?…-*Re-effing-sistance.*

Resistance is a thing, and will come in to punch you in the mouth and sabotage you and your precious resolutions—just like it did last year.

So ok, what to do about?

Well, the way I see it, you have 3 options :

Option 1: Willpower through it. Power through with gritted teeth. Motivation is overrated: just will your hands to move and type, letter by letter, like you’re operating a finicky crane machine in an old arcade.

This is possible, but, like wading upstream of a swift current,  my-oh-my is this exhausting. Productivity prodigies like, *I don’t know…David Goggins?…* can sit down with the beast and barrel through it, but mortals like me and you just won’t have the stamina. No bueno.

Option 2: Do the opposite: indulge the craving for the vice in the hopes that the resistance will pass and you’ll be able to return which a clear brain and a little more focus and motivation.

Lol at this method. It of course never pans out the way you hope, instead snowballing out to all-out binge. Anyway, again, obviously, no bueno.

Option 3: You can *Super Mario the sh\*t out of it*. This is what I do and it works. Allow me to explain.

So you’re 8 again and you’re playing Super Mario World in the basement. You enter a haunted house level (go ahead and play that eerie door hinge sound effect in your head). You advance a bit, when, out from behind you an angry ghost lurches forward. This makes you panic, but you mange to turn Mario around in time  Phew.

Here’s the thing, though. Looking at the ghost doesn't make it die or go away. There's nothing you can make Mario do to eliminate it. The only thing Mario can do is *manage* the ghosts.

With the ghost immobilized, you can take a breath and plan out your next moves. *Ok, I’ll jump on that platform; hit that question mark box; run and duck under that flame, then turn around again and recoup. Ready?... \*exhale\*… ok go...*

In the same way, you can only *manage* Resistance. And this can only be done by facing it. By bringing it into your awareness, like it’s an outside *thing* happening that you can curiously observe.

*Hmm… there he is again… ah yessss… Resistance…what a dick.*

Now, mindfully ‘facing’ the Resistance, doesn’t make it go away. With the Resistance immobilized, you can plan out your next move, just as you would Mario. *Ok… I feel the resistance. I feel the overwhelm at how much work is involved with this project. It is what it is. Ok fine… now, first move: go through my notes and extract the first argument. Then, convert it into a paragraph, then, ok, I’ll pause and recoup. Ready?... \*exhale\*… ok go...*

Then, just as you would playing Mario, with a super focused mental space (i.e. mindful and present to the moment), diligently, carefully, slowly, perform the first task (or set of tasks). If/when you feel the ghost of Resistance creeping back; again, stop. Look at it. Observe it. Take a few breathes, then plan your next moves. Then go forward some more.

String together enough of these ‘stop, observe, plan, go’ sequences and you’ll get through the work session unscathed. It might not be the quickest possible way to get things done—*the quickest way to finish a haunted house level is to ignore the ghosts and sprint through non-stop*—but it’s the surest way. For me, it’s been the only sustainable way to ramp up and maintain a solid and consistent work habit.

So that’s it. Best of luck to you in your noble quest to get disciplined in this upcoming year. And don’t forget... if you slip a bit and get nicked by the damn ghost again… don’t chuck the controller at your little brother… be kind to yourself and just use an extra life to start again… You got this!

lktxp7,"**How procrastination is triggered**: you have to do a *stressful* task. The task is stressful due to a combination of 2 components: performance and time pressure (deadline).

**How you react**: you can either **fight** the source of stress, **flee it**, or **freeze**.

# How each reaction looks like:

* **Flight:** put off the task for as long as possible, until the stress becomes unbearable (deadline approaching), and you're forced to either *fight* or *freeze*.
* **Fight:** tackle the task head on, even with aggressiveness - the typical type A stereotype. When your mindset shifts to fight mode, completing the task becomes very motivating.
* **Freeze:** bury your head figuratively in the sand. You let the deadline pass without doing anything about it, and accept your fate (given another chance, failing, getting fired). In nature, this is the animal playing dead, and letting the predator decide whether it lives or not.

# Common simple scenarios

* **Flight, followed by**
   * **Fight**: putting off tasks until the last minute, then you get a sudden boost of motivation and get it done really quickly. The very common ""I work well under pressure"" kind of procrastination.
   * **Freeze**: putting off tasks until the last minute, then realizing there's no point in putting in any more effort since there's no more time left to do a good job. This is usually a learned behaviour. After too many flight -> fights, eventually the last minute job isn't good enough, and maybe you failed, so now you don't even put up a fight anymore.
* **Fight:** As soon as the stressor (task) comes, sustain fight mode until completion of the task, and it just ends there. Taking breaks isn't ""flight"", it's like taking a rest between boxing rounds; this is important, because fighting takes a lot of energy and it's not sustainable without respite. This is what a lot of us aspire to be.
* **Freeze:** often associated with depression. The person just doesn't try anymore. Ignore bills, ignore e-mails, messages, ignore all the threats.

# How to handle multiple important tasks

* Imagine you're in a fight against multiple opponents.
   * If you have the ability to extend deadlines without consequences, do it. It's easier to fight one-on-one. Extend the deadlines to help you focus on the current fight, but don't abuse it. Once you're done with your current fight, chase down your next opponent or else they'll gang up and eventually corner you.
   * Delegate if possible. If you got friends in your fight, use them wisely.
   * Prioritize the deadliest opponents. If one of your opponents has a gun, you better take them out quickly. This is an analogy to tasks with the highest pressure consequences (final exams, big projects at work, ...)
   * Always fight one-on-one. Focus on what's in front of you, one task at a time. Forget about the other tasks while you're already working on one. Writing what needs to be done in a list helps with that - it gives your brain the permission to temporarily forget about all the other things that need to be done.

# Final thoughts

If you didn't read a single thing. Just remember to keep fighting. If you see yourself running (procrastinating) or freezing, stop running, stop freezing, fight even if you have no chance, fight until death. Once you've defeated all the opponents coming to get you, become a predator yourself. Seek out tasks to fight. In real life, this translates into taking initiative.

**Tangential cultural references**

In many Asian cultures, the word of encouragement is actually ""fight fight fight"". In English, we use ""good luck"", implying that success comes from waiting around for good fortune. I wonder if Asians' work ethic is due to this cultural difference of fighting for what you want.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

d27kzr,"**Why we procrastinate**

When faced with a decision to make or a task to complete, we usually rely on our self-control in order to push ourself to get things done. Furthermore, our motivation, which is based on the expectation of receiving some reward for our efforts, can support our self-control, and make it more likely that we will get things done in a timely manner.

However, there are also various demotivating factors that we can experience, which have an opposite effect than our motivation, meaning that they make us more likely to procrastinate. For example, anxiety and fear of failure can cause us to delay unnecessarily, as can being given a task which is unpleasant.

Furthermore, there are some hindering factors that interfere with our self-control and motivation, in a way that also makes us more susceptible to procrastination. For example, mental exhaustion, which occurs as a result of having to work hard all day, can make it more difficult for us to exert self-control if it’s already late at night. Similarly, a large gap between the time when we complete a task and the time at which we will receive the reward for completing it can cause us to discount the value of this reward, which means that its motivational value will be greatly reduced.

As long as our self-control and motivation outweigh the effects of negative factors, despite the hindering factors which interfere with them, we manage to get our work done in a timely manner. However, when the negative factors outweigh our self-control and motivation, we end up procrastinating, by putting off our work either indefinitely, or until some future point in time when the balance shifts in our favor.

**Common factors that lead to procrastination**

* Abstract goals.
* A disconnect from our future-self.
* Feeling overwhelmed.
* Anxiety.
* Task aversion.
* Fear of failure.
* Lack of motivation.
* Sensation seeking.

**Why this matters*

To successfully deal with your procrastination, you need to first figure out why you procrastinate and how your procrastination is preventing you from achieving your goals. This will allow you to formulate a concrete plan of action, based on appropriate anti-procrastination techniques, that will help you deal with your specific reasons for procrastination.

**Closing words**

The *TL;DR* is this: we procrastinate because our self-control and motivation, which might be hindered by factors such as lack of energy or delay between the present and the time when we expect to be rewarded for our efforts, are outweighed by negative factors, such as anxiety or exhaustion. This is important, because you need to understand why you procrastinate if you want to figure out how to successfully overcome your procrastination.

bl47mh,"Over the course of the past couple of years in self-development, I've come down the these conclusions:

1. You are an outsider before you are an insider
2. Everything is hard before it is easy
3. There is an acclimation time before hard becomes easy
4. Once hard becomes easy, it will be something you ""do""
5. Something you ""do"" becomes who you ""are"" over time.
6. Who you ""are"" is changeable moment by moment.

Everything you want to do in life comes down to skills, which are essentially habits, which make up your self-image.

You don't start out as a ""guitarist"" or a ""songwriter"" or an ""artist"" or a ""coder"". These are things you become over time through repetitions.

You start out knowing nothing about the guitar. Your first chord fingerings are very flimsy and your strumming is weak. Over time, when you push past this period of ignorance, you start to become familiar with the instrument. Even further, the guitar eventually becomes an extension of yourself.

Anything you want to do, be, or have in life comes down to repetitions for the most part, which leads to skills.

Want a girlfriend? Talk to more girls. Do more repetitions.

Want a job? Apply to more jobs. Do more repetitions.

Want to sing better? Practice singing every day. Do more repetitions.

Want to get more muscular? Lift more weight over time. Do more repetitions.

You have an identity shift from someone who ""wasn't good with women"" to someone who can easily get a girlfriend whenever he chooses. You have an identity shift from someone who could ""play guitar sorta"" to a ""guitarist"". You have an identity shift from ""someone who writes on the side"" to a ""writer"". That's who you are. And that's very powerful.

But it's not just about doing any old reps, it's about doing the right reps in the right way that lead to a result.

There's a way to play the guitar so you produce beautiful music. There's a way to talk to the opposite sex to produce a spark of attraction. There's a way to apply to a job that will get your application seen. There's a way to do things that produce a good result. These are the rules. Your repetitions need to line up with the ""rules of the game"" to produce a favorable result.

Football without rules isn't football anymore, it's a free-for-all. English without grammar isn't English anymore, it's gibberish. Music without rules isn't music anymore, it's just noise.

You need to make sure you develop the fundamental skills in the game that you're playing. Once you get to a high level of proficiency, then you can color outside the lines a bit. And it comes down to repetitions.

It comes down to doing something every day even in the face of little results.

1g12rvc,"I notice a lot of posts asking advice to start new habits or drop compulsive behaviors, and they all seem to be coming from people in distress.

Although I really sympathize with the situation and would love to give comfort during such hard times, starting new habits requires a structure to do so.

The biggest reason relies on a neurological principle: Executive Function (EF).

Executive Functions works by moderating neural activity and specially emotional reactivity. They are acquired abilities during childhood, which means it's actually a congnitive effort to modulate behavior and fit into social standards.

EFs is how we are able to face problems and decompose in smaller items, how to stop or moderate harmful behaviors, how to think in long-term, how to not overreact and keep our shit together.

Stressors in our life will decrease executive functioning, and so genetic conditions.

And guess what is discipline, or the act to convince ourselves to do something without motivation? That's right. A TON of EFs.

So, before reaching to any miraculous method or tool, it's important to assess how stressors are affecting our lives in the first place, because pretty much they are the reasons you don't feel like being able to do things without motivation.

Going to the gym for example is a quite easy task, but if you suffer from low self esteem and social phobias, it will require a lot more from your EFs to overcome unregulated emotions and task initiation.

Working on different projects will require an immense pressure over EFs as it essentially will use all of them. So if you are a gym rat, it doesn't mean you will also be able to write a novel while developing an app in +8h per day. Without proper stress management, it's perfectly possible to be disciplined in some subjects and undisciplined in others.

Not to mention other conditions which will certainly affect EFs, such as ADHD, ASD and OCD.

Not being disciplined is not the end of the world, and you shouldn't feel ashamed nor feel like a failing for not being able to do a few things. Sometimes is just the way our body and mind is asking for help.

Removal of stressors, and most importantly, being gentle to yourself and accept processes with proper time will make the control much easier, and sometimes there are things that simply won't work as we expect, and that's ok.

This is by no means a scientific approach, it is just a  personal trick I have found to work on me and believe it might also have  some scientific basis.

I am planning to release a series of articles about dealing with perfectionism, procrastination and decision making.

I am posting now the first part and if there are people who want me to share the other parts, I will do so in the next days. Please write a comment if you want the other parts!

Thank you and here we go 

Do you recognize yourself in the following lines?

*I can’t stop thinking about a mistake I made.*

*When I have made a decision I often doubt my choice.*

*I feel inferior to people more successful than me.*

*Every thing I do has to be 100% perfect.*

*I tend to ruminate and overthink a lot.*

*I have an all-or-nothing thinking.*

You are trying to make the best decision, but you cannot decide which one is the best. You make lists over lists, you overthink for months and you end up… nowhere. After that, you’re saying to yourself that you’re going to do this no matter what, that you cannot waste your time anymore – you feel a power within yourself to change yourself for the better but when you are facing decision making and actually doing things… procrastination and frustration win the stage.

In time, things are getting worse by starting to regret the wasted time and the wasted opportunities wasted. To make the situation even worse, you start comparing yourself to others: “Why they can do more?”, “Why do they have more?” And there is an endless loop of frustration, anxiety and pain which seems you cannot get out of.

Congrats! You are a perfectionist like I was! I know your struggle and your pain and I am here to help you guide to solve some of these problems. I know what I’ve been through and I know what I am talking about.

People of Reddit, are you ready?

So.

Let’s know what a perfectionist is. The main definition of a perfectionist is a person who is judging his self-worth based on his achievements. The problem is not this – the problem is that a perfectionist has very very high unrelenting standards that no one can ever achieve. Even if someone is saying to him that what he’s done is **more than enough**, he will not believe that person. It’s awful thinking this way! A perfectionist tends to see only the things he or she did not accomplish!

In this text I am going to focus on one of the two types of perfectionists – the ones who procrastinate by waiting for the best time to start and the best opportunity to come. The other one is the one who works a lot which can ruin his emotional and physical health – their chain of thoughts is “I have to work and work all day to achieve my goal!”.

Next.

A lazy perfectionist, a procrastinator, so to say, is the one who is waiting for the best opportunity to make the best move and to get the perfect result. This is the most basic definition. Where is the problem? The problem is that he never begins due to certain reasons:

a.  Black and white thinking – “I either do it fully, or I don’t do it at all”;

b.  Catastrophising – they beat themselves up by making a tiny tiny small mistake;

c.  High standards – that **cannot** be achieved by anyone;

d.  Overthinking, rumination – think things inside out and not taking any action;

e.  Excessive list making – making plans repeatedly and not taking any action.

Being is perfectionist is, by definition, wrong from the beginning. Why? No man alive ever in his life went from A to B perfectly, without encountering obstacles, without having struggles and without having any losses. Trying to make things perfect all the time will only get you making your life worse. Things are *perfectable*, but they can never be perfect. It’s ok, it’s highly recommended to aim high, but you should have in mind that things might no go as you though of. *(or maybe this is the beauty of life :)*

Someone who procrastinates stays in a neverending loop of rumination and overthinking. **You cannot evolve while you stay**. You gotta put some action. The question is: *how?*

I am a guy who struggled with perfectionism all his life. I did not know that I had this \*issue – so to speak –\*until I started to get into psychology and self-help. In the past 4 years, I got into this domain and the more I explored it the more I discovered myself and got to know why people think the way they think and why people act the way they act.

So.

In order to solve a problem, you have to define the problem. If you do not know what you are confronting with, you will always be in the fog waving the sword to the dragons that are not there.

Like I said earlier, I am going to focus on the perfectionists who procrastinate and who had a hard time making the perfect decision.

In order to deal with this issue, we need an holistic approach. The following lines are derived from my experience of dealing with perfectionism and the books I’ve read, videos I watched and successful people I modelled. **These are guidelines, not recipes!**

**You need to be guided, you don’t need a universal recipe! Because there are no universal recipes, each one of us is** **unique!** ***<- I can’t emphasize enough this statement.***

Ok. Let’s see!

There are four main areas in your life you need to focus on, to work on. These areas are interrelated.

1. Family & friends – here is included your parents’ family, your own family with your spouse and your relationship with your friends – this segment is about social life and social circles you are present in;
2. Job & career – there is a difference – in a job you work like 8-10h/day and having a career requires that you work as much as you can;
3. Leisure time – the time you have outside work should be used properly. For most of the people their jobs are not their dream jobs. So, you need the time outside work to use it for your hobbies and activities that will charge you with positive energy;
4. Physical and mental health – it need to be maintained in order to function properly in the society, at job and in family.

I categorized *life* in these four parts to understand better how to handle the problem. If you don’t understand now, be patient, you’ll get it later from this text.

This text is about helping you making the right decision, building healthy and worthy habits and living a much more meaningful life. By following the information in the next pages you will become less stressed and less anxious, you will be more in control of your life and you will have stability in your life. You will learn that fear of failure can be just an illusion because, most of the times, failure can be the greatest thing that ever happened to you. You will no longer procrastinate over small tasks and the big one and you will feel more productive and you’ll get the sense that you are going somewhere worthwhile. You will learn how to handle your perfectionism.

Next.

Human beings need a target. We need a goal. Having no goal is very problematic. You should have a goal that is worth by your standards. And here we are facing the first problem of being a perfectionist.

You are going to find these targets/goals in the four main areas described above. Life is divided into these parts – by doing so, it is easier to orient yourself in live and to make an accurate decision.

What are my goals? Which goal is the best for me? What if I start pursuing one goal and I miss the other one? What if I will never do what I like? How do I get straight from A to B? this is how a perfectionist is thinking. Wanna tell you a secret: **almost never you’re ever going from A to B. Because it simply … can’t.**

Thank you for your time and please comment if you have any questions!

And please do not forget to tell me if you want the other parts!!!

Don’t ask for my credentials or backstory… I’m not a down-and-out drug addict turned-janitor-turned-professional-turned-CEO-turned motivational speaker, I’m just a 24yo dude who’s striving for self-improvement, and decided to type up some guidelines which I believe would help one lead a fulfilling life. A lot of it is regurgitation of self-help lit I’ve read, and a lot of it is admittedly platitude, but I figured that if nothing else, it would help reinforce these positive mindsets;

**10 key mindset principles/strategies to embrace;**

**1) Love yourself.** You deserve the best. You should strive for your potential - the most fulfilled version of yourself - and that potential is virtually limitless. This is the single most important mindset to adopt, as it serves as a foundation for literally everything else. It’s not a case of arrogance or entitlement, but in the sense that you would want the best for a family member of SO that you deeply love. A lot of people self-sabotage (often inadvertently), and complain that they can’t break free of negative habits… I believe this is largely due to the fact that deep down they’ve built up so much self-hatred that they don’t even feel worthy of attaining their goals and living their most fulfilling life. Fuck that. I don’t care what your backstory is, you are worthy. I am. We all are. You wouldn’t be reading this if you didn’t believe you were.

**2)** **Understand that you are the architect of your fate.** A lot of people adopt a fatalistic mindset as a coping mechanism, but instead believe that you can achieve anything you set your mind to, and let go of limiting beliefs. Sounds like some bombastic BS you were told in primary school before reality hit you like a ton of bricks right? I thought so too since I’m a rational minded guy, but then I realized there’s literally no sense in not believing that. Yeah you’ll probably never win Mr Olympia, you’ll probably never be a billionaire, you’ll probably never be entirely content with the choices you’ve made  – but that shouldn’t stop you from trying to attain your aspirations and realize your ~~dreams~~ potential. Dreams are passive not proactive. No matter how disastrous your position may seem, I can guarantee that people in worse positions have gone on to achieve their goals through the adoption of principles not unlike these. Use that as inspiration.

Also remember that no matter how ‘unfair’ life has been to you; whether you were born crippled, had to bury your child, were wrongly imprisoned for 20 years – you are the only one who can help yourself now, so long as there’s a will, which ties back to the first principle. When life gives you lemons, you can either squeeze them in your eyes, or make lemonade…you can’t change the hand you’ve been given, but you decide how to play it. You’re not responsible for all the things that befall you, but you’re entirely responsible for how you deal with them, which in turn will determine future events. So in this sense, whilst a few pages will be torn, you can write your future. This notion should be empowering, not daunting.

Be mindful that whilst learning from the past, and planning for the future you should still very much be living in the present. Don't just dwell in the past and dream of the future; If your life were a film, that would be tantamount to you whipping out your phone half-way through and re-watching the intro scene on YouTube, or conversely, browsing Reddit during a slower paced character development section whilst you wait for a cool scene. It's a rather shit way to watch a movie. There are valid reasons why one may attempt to avoid the present - pain, grief, anticipation, yearning and so on - but these headspaces are like quicksand in that the longer you allow yourself to wallow in them the deeper you'll sink, and the harder it will become to return to the present. Completely dysfunctional PTSD afflicted war veterans have gone on to recover and lead healthy lives, so it's entirely possible.

'Neuroplasticity' is an incontrovertible phenomenon...you're always capable of changing your brain for the better.

**3)** **Never stop growing.** Never rest on your laurels. Be proud of past accomplishments, but understand that you’re forever a work in progress, and always be eager to continue refining yourself. Don’t allow your static achievements to define you; “I won a national bodybuilding competition”, “I got the highest grade in my cohort”, “I earn the most out of my peer group”… they’re not solid foundations for self-worth. Instead, be proud of the fortitude, dedication, creativity etc you possess, which manifested in such achievements. Circumstances can change as the wind blows, but mental faculties you’ve developed will remain a core part of your character. Learn from constructive criticism, but dismiss other forms.

**4)** **Don’t let a molehill develop into a mountain** – pull the bandaid off quickly. When you procrastinate, the thing you’re avoiding doesn’t disappear, it just amplifies until it’s almost (mentally) insurmountable. Time spent procrastinating is never remotely enjoyable. You always have that sword looming over your head everywhere you go, everything you do. Train yourself to get used to acting as early as possible and getting it over with – then enjoying the satisfaction of doing so.

Hearken the Nike slogan and…just do it. Beginning is always the greatest hurdle. If you’re a master procrastinator you’ll need to pull in the opposite direction and essentially turn your mind off and just start the task at hand. Literally, pretend you’re a non-sentient creature devoid of higher thought for the 30 seconds it takes to open up your Assignment document and type your name, or 5 minutes that it takes to drive to the gym, or 5 seconds that it takes to approach the cute girl who smiled at you earlier. Just go through the motions. You’ll be amazed at how well you handle the next steps, and it’ll become slightly easier every time.

Another good rule of thumb; If something can be done in 5 minutes or less, and you aren’t driving on the freeway or holding a newborn baby, drop what you’re doing and get it done immediately.

I've mentally imprinted the phrase ""A year from now, you'll wish you had started today"" and I refer to that every now and then when I sense myself stalling off a new task.

Be aware of any perfectionist streak you may have, and try to keep it in check. The law of diminishing returns applies to most facets of life. Some degree of perfectionism can be leveraged as a virtue, but the maladaptive form will lead to 'analysis paralysis', inefficiency, and ironically a poor outcome - because at this level the context is irrelevant, and it's simply a manifestation of insecurity. If you must channel your perfectionism into something, let it be an artistic hobby or something of personal nature, and learn when to let go in other time-sensitive areas.

**5) Understand that life isn’t supposed to be easy**…and it would be boring if it were. There’s a quote painted on the wall of my gym “nothing worth achieving was ever achieved without effort."" I used to roll my eyes, but now I realize how incredibly accurate it is.

Imaging yourself having infinite wealth… once you’ve got the holidaying, partying, debauchery and materialistic spending sprees out of your system…unless you’ve cultivated some form of passion or cause you can devote yourself to, imagine how fucking unfulfilling and apathetic that lifestyle would be. Everything would lose its value, including relationships, and you’d struggle to find the motivation to do almost anything.

Learn to enjoy the grind itself, not merely the outcome…the journey not the destination. That’s the essence of life.

Naturally, without the negative spectrum of emotions and experiences, the positive ones wouldn't exist either. Without adversity there would be no triumph. No matter how mentally resilient you become, you'll always encounter fear...but in reality true courage isn't a lack of fear, it's acting in spite of it. I'm sure Ned Stark would agree.

**6)** **Galvanize yourself into taking positive action.** Your conscience/intuition/better judgement, whatever you want to call it, generally knows what’s best for you and what it takes to get there, but is often overpowered by the pessimist in us. Here are two techniques you can use to confront that pessimistic voice;

1 **Retroactive self-reflection**. Here’s a confronting visualization activity to motivate you into taking action; When faced with a daunting decision or challenge (one that you want to take but are hampered by your negative thoughts), envision yourself as an old folk – Zimmer frame, toothless, baby food, incontinent, lonely, family only drop in once a month if you’re lucky – and you’re propped in front of the TV, but you’re not watching daytime talk shows, rather you’re viewing a montage of all the opportunities you’ve passed up in your younger life, and you’re writhing with regret because you’ll never know what could have been. Attach this scenario to a word or phrase you can mutter so you’re not actually trying to imagine an old man shitting himself when you’re at a critical moment. Remember two adages; If you try you risk failure, if you back out you assure it; rejection stings for a minute (perhaps even a month), but regret will haunt you for a lifetime.

2 **Explicitly stating negative behaviors before or whilst you’re engaging in them**. For instance “I’m going to procrastinate on reddit for the rest of the evening,  then panic tomorrow afternoon when I realize the assignment Is due in a few hours and I haven't even started”, “I’m going to allow a spiteful comment to ruin my entire day because my self-worth is completely dependent on what a stranger thinks of me” “I’m now going to go masturbate to some unrealistic BS for 40 seconds of mild pleasure then feel utterly awful afterwards, and ruin one of my socks in the process” . Make sure to articulate it in a silly voice so it highlights how ridiculous that line of thinking is, and separates it from the self that wants to improve i.e. the true self. If you're anything like me, you'll actually struggle to even get the full thing out before you're launching a counterattack.

**7) Interrupt negative thoughts with positive ones.** Just as the former pervade your mind whenever you consider a possibility or opportunity, you can give them a taste of their own medicine by interrupting them with optimism. For instance fellas; you see a gorgeous, friendly looking girl browsing a few meters away at the supermarket, you make eye contact and she briefly smiles at you…your immediate response is actually to approach her…but that thought is swiftly interrupted by “What if she thinks I’m creepy? What if this complete stranger laughs at my face? What if I shit my pants and vomit on her?” The solution; interrupt those pessimistic thoughts instantaneously with “or what if we have incredibly chemistry, we’re exactly what the other one has been searching for, and we fall into a passionate romance that develops into a lifelong partnership?” or “so what if that happens? If she thinks I’m creepy I’ll know I need to work on how I project myself. If she laughs at me I will have dodged a bullet. If I shit myself and vomit I’ll become more resilient for it as I will have survived the worst case scenario.” So put yourself outside your comfort zone, and into situations where you’ll have the opportunity to silence that naysaying motherfucker...then to really spite it, take action.

Of course, in situations where there is a substantial degree of risk, you must make the distinction between baseless pessimistic thoughts (which should be overridden) versus the conscience speaking from experience (which should be heeded within reason).

**8)** **Positively reframe situations.** Similar to the previous point, but more generalized. Instead of looking at the gym as a place of sweat and pain, look at it as a place for strengthening the body and mind. Instead of looking at a job interview as a torturous exercise in awkward silences,  humble bragging, and sycophantism, look at is as an opportunity to improve the way you project yourself, fortify mental resilience, and potentially enter a fulfilling career. Instead of telling yourself ‘I can’t do this’ or ‘I’m terrible at this’ include the addendum ‘yet’ and ‘but, I can learn’.  Learn to enjoy challenges as they become opportunities for either success or learning. Look at failures as chances for error correction and personal growth. Learn to deal with setbacks and failures constructively, without giving up and reverting back to detrimental habits. Don’t expect yourself to fail, but don’t lambaste yourself if you do – treat it all as a learning exercise. Many are scared to try their absolute hardest in the fear that they may still ‘fail’ – however the silver lining in this situation is that you’ve now experienced the worst case scenario and lived to tell the tale, thus you become more resilient to future failures, and are able to focus on identifying causes rather than the act itself.  After all, humanity has progressed on the back of countless failures, but wouldn’t have if they were never capitalized as learning opportunities.

**9)** **Any progress is good progress**. Rome wasn’t built in a day. You can’t edit a blank page. Don’t expect to go from a lazy, unstructured layabout to Mr Efficiency overnight, over a week, over a month, even over a year – this is placing (often deliberately) unrealistic expectations on yourself and setting yourself up for disappointment. Deeply ingrained negative thought loops and harmful habits take time to overcome and redirect into positive ones. Our brains are adaptable and It will happen eventually, but it’s done incrementally, and it takes time, consistency and resolve. Divide large tasks into manageable chunks; a series of sprints rather than trying to run the marathon. Everyone runs their own race at their own pace – don’t exclusively compare your progress to that of somebody else, no matter how similar you believe yourselves to be. The only person you should truly compare yourself to is your younger self. Another crucial axiom to remember when pursuing long-term goals is ""Never give up on a ~~dream~~ goal because of the time it will take to accomplish. The time will pass anyway.""

Caveat: Comparing oneself to others is natural, and you'll be judged in relation to others throughout life in a social and professional context - however when determining personal progress, your best yardstick is yourself.

 

**10)** **Keep yourself accountable.** Note the tasks you wish to achieve that day in a journal of some sort, and reflect on your completion of them at the end. Commend yourself for achievements, but don’t chastise yourself over those you didn’t. This is crucial in building self-efficacy, and eventually it will become habitual. Try to minimize the concessions you give yourself;  “Today is gonna be a lazy day, I’ll get back on top of things tomorrow” but don’t allow a slip up to completely ruin any momentum and progress you’ve made. You’re only human, and even the most productive people have ‘lazy days’  – plus self-disgust isn’t a sustainable motivator to improve.  Nonetheless, endeavor to remain mindful of what you’re doing as often as possible, and gently guide yourself back on track if you’ve become derailed. At the other end of the spectrum, thrive on the liberating moments where you've managed to turn off autopilot and take the reins of your own life - use this to drive further constructive behavior.

&#x200B;

**Life guidance:**

&#x200B;

**Physiological;**

\- Ensure you get sufficient sleep (at least 6 hours), during roughly the same time windows each night. Emphasis on night because daytime sleep isn’t as rejuvenating. Don’t lay in bed in the morning, get up immediately. Circadian rhythm has an enormous impact on mood, and metabolism, so optimize it.

\- Have cold showers to build self-efficacy In a tangible way (start with them warm but finish with them cold if you prefer)

\- Stop any intensely stimulating activity and go screen free for at least half an hour before attempting to sleep, as blue light suppresses melanin production.

\- Exercise routinely and consistently. Increased energy levels, increased virility, improved self-esteem, and mood elevation are well known corollaries. It’s also a microcosm for seeing the direct and tangible results of hard work. Go for a mix of weightlifting and cardio but tailor them to your specific goals. Remember to stretch, do any preventative and rehabilitative exercises if required - remember the golden rule; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As with most things extremity isn't healthy either - steroid use, deliberately dehydrating, extreme distance running, competitive powerlifting etc, but that's your prerogative.

\- Ensure you aren’t sedentary for hours on end.  Aim to get up and walk around at least once every hour.

\- Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Calculate your calorie requirements and try counting calorie intake a few times roughly understand how it translates to food. Food is your body's fuel source, and it's incredible how many people put more thought into filling up their vehicle than their own body. Try to spread meals throughout the day for ongoing energy, and limit the amount you eat during nocturnal hours. Stay hydrated.

\- Do what you can to improve your physical appearance and presentation within reason; take care of your hair and skin, ensure good dental hygiene, use antiperspirants and deodorant to eliminate BO... but don’t obsess over appearance/become conceited.

\- Without being neurotic, take any preventative measures you can to maintain optimal constitution; wear sunscreen, use eye protection, work ergonomically, floss etc.

\- If you wish to express your creative/counter-cultural/rebellious/zany side through your appearance, go right ahead, but remember that unfortunately there are still many who will form preconceptions based on your appearance (yes that’s a fault on their part…but still something you'll have to deal with).

\- Don’t overly stress about aches and pains, but have routine check-ups, and visit sooner rather than later if you believe something is amiss with your health.

\- Try not to put yourself in overly risky situations. It's natural to seek adrenaline, but take a minute to weigh up the risks before doing something which your better judgement is advising against.

\- Remember you only get one body (and mind), so take bloody good care of it.

&#x200B;

**Social and Relationships;**

\- Socialize as much as possible (even if you have to force yourself sometimes). If you don’t enjoy socializing with your current friends, try to find those with whom you do. Humans are social creatures, and long-term solitude takes a heavy toll on one’s mental state.

\- Money, status, appearance…nothing can buy authentic positive relationships. Never take them for granted. They’re perhaps the truest indicator of a ‘successful’ life. Love, friendship, and respect aren’t unconditional. If they were, they would be meaningless. Take an interest in other peoples lives. And no matter how frustrated you are, never leave a partner, family member, or friend on a bad note.

\- Aim to give your family the best side of yourself. Unfortunately we seem to have an almost natural instinct to displace frustration and anger built up from work and daily life onto family members, because we can ostensibly get away with it. People can be tolerant and forgiving towards their loved ones, but they're not stress balls with 10 minute memories. Make a conscious effort to be good to them no matter how shit you're feeling, because they deserve that treatment, and so do you.

\- Help others. Again, we’re social creatures and the act of helping others in need delivers tremendous boosts to self-worth (In this sense I think altruism is a paradox but that another topic).

\- Mood is contagious. Try to surround yourself with positive people who inspire you and encourage you to chase your potential.

\- Try to help troubled friends/family in whatever ways you can, but know where to draw the line, at which point their wellbeing is out of your hands, and worrying is only going to pain you.

\- Avoid or cut out unequivocally toxic people. I don’t believe anyone is evil, or beyond redemption, but minimize your exposure to those who only bring you down.

\- Try to find a partner who is essentially a best friend...albeit with benefits. Romance will eventually fade, and you want to ensure that you’re left with somebody you can spend your life with who’s personality is a good compliment to yours.

\- Remember when you allow somebody to build you up, you give them the power to break you down. Allow yourself to become infatuated with someone, but don’t allow your self-worth to hinge on their feelings toward you. Never make someone a priority if they only make you an option. Desperation and neediness are two of the most unattractive qualities somebody can exhibit.

\- If you can feel yourself losing your temper, briefly envisage that somebody you deeply respect, or somebody who looks up to you as a role model is present and think twice. Anger never wins arguments either. Also ask yourself if the frustration will still exist a week from now...chances are the answer is no.

\- Little acts of kindness/thoughtfulness such as genuine compliments (not effusively) go a long way and can truly make somebody’s day. If more people adhered to this the world would be a slightly more pleasant place. People don't often remember what you do or say, but they remember how you make them feel - so even if the act is seemingly insignificant, it will be remembered in a positive light.

\- In a relationship; lay solid foundations early on and don't expect issues to simply resolve themselves later down the line, communication and trust are the two cornerstones, be ok with spending time apart and maintaining your own lives, reframe arguments as 'us' versus 'the problem', don't sacrifice personal passions, remember that emotions are irrational and can't be analyzed only accepted, they're a two-way street which require equivalent effort from both parties to function whatsoever let alone healthily.

&#x200B;

**Career;**

&#x200B;

\- Try to work within a career you find fulfilling, but understand that the notion of ‘doing what you love’ is specious, and in some cases can actually ruin the passion if you associate it too closely with mundane work. You can still find your work fulfilling without having a ‘passion’ for it, such as when you feel you’re having a positive impact, being adequately recognized, or have achieved mastery in a given area.

\- Don't be afraid to leverage Nepotism. There's nothing dishonorable or condemnatory about it. Perhaps there was once, but these days it's basically the norm. So the CEO's wife's sisters hairdressers less qualified son got the job instead of you - people like doing personal favors. Don't hate the players or the game, learn to use that to your advantage. Expand your network, and do favors for others so they can reciprocate. Who you know gets you the job then what you know keeps you in it.

\- In an interview; Ensure you arrive a few minutes early so you're not additionally stressed. Bring a copy of your resume. Prepare sufficiently - no matter how much you hate the idea of pre-rehearsed responses, no matter how skilled at speaking extemporaneously you may be, it's still worth anticipating questions and planning answers. Research the company and industry. Maintain good body language and eye contact. Don't criticize past employers (find a more constructive way to discuss difficulties). Show a glimpse of your personality/humor but be reserved/formal. Don't be afraid to pause and think before answering (something that society needs to do more in general). Ask them questions; ""what are a few words you would use to describe the culture of the company?"" ""What do you personally enjoy most about working here?"" ""Let's say I've been selected for the role - what measures will be used to gauge my performance?"" Remember it's a two-way process - you're also trying to determine whether it's a place that you want to spend most of your waking life (granted you can't always afford to be very picky).

\- In a workplace;  Be friendly, authentic and don't hide your personality but maintain a degree professionalism (especially at after work drinks etc). avoid very controversial discussions, politics and drama wherever possible even if you secretly thrive on that. don't shit where you eat so to speak. Keep a low(ish) profile and work particularly hard initially to make a good first impression. Make yourself less expendable by putting yourself in linchpin positions with projects and tasks wherever possible. do (reasonable) favors for coworkers. Try to ensure that others can clearly see the results of your work/effort. Don't be afraid to (tactfully) assert your opinion to your superiors or anybody if you believe it's worth hearing - they won't see it as some act of insubordination, and they'll probably respect you for it.

&#x200B;

**Misc Lifestyle;**

\- Do not even consider having a child until you and your partner are ready to dedicate your lives to raising them as healthily as possible. If you’re not in a position to adequately provide for them (financially or emotionally), or you have personal aspirations that will be difficult to achieve as a parent, you’re not ready. This is the one thing in your life that you can't half-ass, and there’s really no margin for error here.

\- Finance wise, create a separate savings account in which a portion of your income is automatically deposited (or do so manually) - one that gains the maximum interest offered and which you don't touch unless times are tough. Only withdraw from it when faced with a crisis or when carrying out a significant well-thought out purchase, otherwise treat it as though it doesn't exist. Don't get caught up in the paper chase and hoard copious amounts of money - ensure your family is well off and has future financial security for peace of mind, but don't become parsimonious. Money spent creating happy memories (or attempting to) is never wasted. Invest in passions and hobbies within reason, donate to virtuous causes, travel and see as much of the world as you can. Never judge somebody purely by their wealth; given that it's not everybody's goal and there are so many other factors, it shouldn't be used as a universal metric for success.

\- Always find time to indulge in passions or interests, as they have a significantly positive impact on one’s mood and outlook. My primary passion is music, and It's honestly been a lifeline for me.

\- Cut out porn. forever. It’s not just desensitizing you sexually and creating unrealistic expectations, but the dopamine rush associated with it mimics drug use, and is insidious in the long run. Sublimate those urges into productive tasks or behaviors that will help you attain the real thing. It’s hard, but worth it. Also put time boundaries on general internet usage.

\- Learn how to cook. Save money, build self-sufficiency, conducive to being healthy, and it's a very attractive trait.

\- Try to be punctual and stick to your word. Reliability is one of the most vital attributes in both a social and professional context. Unreliability is often interpreted as a lack of respect for the other parties in the social setting, and a lack of regard for one's work in the professional setting.

\- Read. Ideally edifying content, but not purely self-help literature - anything that engages you - fiction or not fiction. Besides from being enjoyable, it delivers a plethora of benefits. Alternatively, listen to audio books or podcasts.

\- Ideally, don’t do drugs, don’t smoke, and keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. I’m far from a prude, and I’ve done my share of substances, but they really can precipitate a downward spiral, particularly in people more susceptible to addiction and mental disorders. Life is challenging enough without them.  Prove to yourself that you don't need to rely on them as a social crutch, or as a temporary escape from reality, because that becomes self-perpetuating.

\- Be ambitious; try new things, visit new places, speak to strangers – you never know where they may lead, and what hidden passions may be uncovered by doing so. Remember that friends are just strangers you haven't met yet. So are enemies, but that doesn't help my point.

\- Say yes to (m)any offers/opportunities besides those in which your conscience/intuition/gut is firmly telling you not to - socially, professionally, romantically, etc. This isn't a 2008 comedy Starring Jim Carey, so don't feel guilty for saying 'no', but challenge yourself to take up auspicious offers you would usually refuse.

\- Keep up to date with current events and friends lives, but be wary of the pernicious effects of the news and social media. The former is sensationalized and catastrophized for mass appeal (vicariously), and the latter presents a very distorted portrait of peoples lives (aka their highlights) which can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Try to detach from sources that exacerbate your insecurity (social influencers), and follow sources that inspire creativity and zeal (artists).

\- Try to minimize the amount of lies (even white lies) you tell. Others may never know the truth, but you have to carry the guilt around, and it begins to erode your self-concept.

\- Use a diary, calendar, or some form of system to manage your time as effectively as possible. It’s incredible how much time seems to materialise out of thin air once you’re using it more efficiently. Life is short. Time flies by just as fast when you’re moping around in apathy...the difference is you aren’t getting anything accomplished and consequently feeling guilty for it.

\- Find 10 minutes to do something meditative each day. It doesn’t need to be meditation per se, but anything that allows you to reach a state of tranquility and block out the noise of daily life – known to reduce stress and help build self-awareness. Eventually you’ll be able to enter this state with greater ease, and it can be a useful tool to use when required.

\- Play a sport/join a club. Ideally something that you're interested in, but really anything to keep you active, socializing, and expanding your friend network. Social leagues are a good idea, because they're not so competitive that there's stress involved, but they tick the other boxes.

\- Even if you despise politics, take a small time to research the policies and recent history of the political parties you'll be deciding between,  so you can have a somewhat informed vote. Consider whether they're designed to be immediately appealing or beneficial in the longer-term. Political parties know that most don't bother to do any research in the lead up, so try to win votes via methods such as propaganda, smear campaigns, hollow rhetoric, and fear mongering.  Even if you'rel disillusioned with the system, don't allow that to prevent you from using your vote, and if you're not fond of any of the parties still vote for the one(s) you're least not fond of (there's a simpler way to say that). If political discussion only frustrates you as it does with many, then avoid it until it comes time to vote again... short of engaging in political activism there's nothing you can do once the ballots have been counted anyway.

\- Compartmentalize your tasks and mindframes; work hard, play hard. Attempting both concurrently will leave you in limbo.

&#x200B;

**Philosophical;**

\- A meaningless existence doesn't necessitate a purposeless life - it means you get to decide what that purpose is. Life is your playground. As an atheist, I'm living under the assumption that this is it. I've never let that thought demoralize me though, rather I've always viewed it as being life-affirming. I've no idea why anything is as it is, why nature is in relentless pursuit of procreation, why we've developed the sentience to question our own existence - but these aren't questions that will ever be answered. The fact is we're here, we all have the ability to experience intrigue, wonderment, joy, pleasure, mirth, love and fulfillment to some capacity even if we don't understand why, so we might as well capitalize on this and try to maximize these in our lives and the lives of those around us.

\- If you haven’t identified any strong passions in your life, don’t despair. Continue improving yourself in every other general sense, and understand that (arguably) most people don’t have burning, innate passions – they’re often more subtly disguised and uncovered serendipitously. Either way, a lack of strong passion(s) won’t prevent you from living a rich and fulfilling life.

\- Be skeptical, never cynical. The former will help guide your decisions, the latter will just preclude opportunities. Question everything, make minimal assumptions, if a statement sounds fanciful, it likely is. Operate with the knowledge that some people will sometimes employ machiavellianism to benefit their own agenda, as we all have done to some degree, however don't resign to the belief that everybody you meet is full of deceit until proven otherwise, as that will lead to general bitterness toward society.

\- Learn how to have debates not arguments; always focus on the issue and don't resort to ad hominen attacks (even if they do) as that will weaken your stance and chance you have of persuading the other party. Remember that many peoples opinions have been deeply ingrained and reinforced throughout their life via confirmation bias, so often they'll cling to their argument even if they can see the error, to avoid embarrassment and hypocrisy. Try to enter into discussions with a (genuinely) open mind, willing to have your view changed. You never actually learn from those who agree with you, so debating is a healthy way to challenge your own beliefs.

\- Attempt to minimize knee-jerk reactions & pearl-clutching in response to taboo or contentious topics, as that's inimical to productive discourse and progression in general.

\- Practice gratitude - from family support to simplicities such as running water - as it will help with positive reframing.

\- Remember that your mind is a product of its genome (biology) and envirome (environment and experience/nurture); stereotyping/typecasting/xenophobia etc are natural heuristics inculcated throughout history as it offered a survival advantage in the days of tribalism, thus embedded in our biology. You can, and should always attempt to consciously override it, but don't be disgusted with yourself, or others for instinctively doing so. Social norms evolve faster than biology; that should never be used as an excuse, just an explanation.

\- Never prejudge anybody based on their title – purely by the integrity of their character. There are corrupt doctors who’ve beguiled their way through life, and honest vagrants who’s honor was their undoing. You be the judge. *Try* to avoid evaluating somebody’s character until you know their story; they could be trudging through the darkest hour of their life without any coping strategies, as expressed through hostility and negativity.

\- Truly dominant individuals don't need to try to make their dominance known, as they're quietly confident in themselves. In the wise words of Tywin Lannister; ""Any man who must exclaim 'I am the King' is no true king""

\- Don’t try to be something you’re not. Place yourself in settings where you feel comfortable speaking your mind;  remove yourself from those in which you don't. Adapt to the social context of course - nobody acts exactly the same around everybody so don't feel guilt - but don’t compromise core values for other peoples approval. Social acceptance is biologically instilled in us, but accept that not everybody you meet is going to like you, and if they simply like your tailored persona then they don’t truly like you. Remember the asshole equation; if somebody is rude to you, they're the asshole (or going through tough times)...if everybody is rude to you, you're the asshole.

\- Try to be less judgmental and more empathetic toward others for holding their values and opinions. Introjection and indoctrination are powerful processes. Put yourself in their shoes to determine why they do, think and say the things they do. Do the same with yourself pertaining strong opinions you hold.

\- Remember that (virtually) nobody thinks of themselves as being the bad guy in a situation. You judge yourself by your intentions and others by their actions. Everyone is entitled to fuck up, just as you are, and theoretically, why would you be any different to them if you were in their shoes? Never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance.

\- Never hold against somebody that which was out of their control. Ethnicity, heritage, gender, religion, sexual orientation ,fetishes, birth defects, the fact that their father is a convicted serial killer – everybody deserves to be born with a clean slate. It's senseless being proud or ashamed of your heritage/lineage, as you've personally had no influence over it's development, and therefore shouldn't allow it to have any effect on your self-worth... doing so would undermine the agency of the individual.

\- Live and let live – everybody has different trajectories in life. If somebody wants to get face tattoos, dedicate their life to bodybuilding, marry a member of the same sex, as long as it’s not directly effecting you, who gives a shit? If you know them closely you can voice your opinion, offer your wisdom, but so long as it's bringing them happiness and not harming others, it's their life - and you have no right to dictate how they live it.

\- Seek to find joy everyday in the small things. The big picture is frankly bleak; we’ll all have to part with the ones we love eventually, and who knows what becomes afterwards, so don’t dwell on it. Of course, that’s not to say don’t pursue long-term goals, as those are what will bring fulfillment.

\- Ultimately, don’t take life too seriously. Laugh instead of cry. Literally nothing is too serious to be joked about (besides the obvious things like metal splinters, single ply toilet paper, Uni group projects and cassowaries), but know when to laugh. Don't immediately judge others for making light of morbid situations, as it's a common coping mechanism. Be able to laugh about your own 'flaws' - but if you'd rather not, and have the ability, do something about them. Summarized by a great quote; ""take your responsibilities seriously, but not yourself.""

**P.S. Mental Illness;**

Addressing the elephant in the room; mental disorders. I deliberately avoided mentioning them, so not to invalidate the advice offered. Utilize the above advice after treating any underlying mental disorders you may be harboring.

If really struggling, consider speaking to a psychologist/therapist, as their detached yet knowledgeable perspective can be valuable. A good method for self-reflection if nothing else.

If completely devoid of hope and unable to cope, if the negative voice in your head is deafening, if you’re paralyzed by anxiety - see a psychiatrist ASAP.

Unfortunately in some cases the only way to rectify aberrant mood and thought is through psychiatric treatment...medication, CBT, ECT...it works. There’s no longer a stigma, and if somebody condemns you for seeking mental health treatment that's merely a reflection of their ignorance and insecurity.

Of course, this will only serve to get you back on your feet - then it’s the adoption of principles such as these that will have you racing toward your potential!",r/getdisciplined,[Advice] A Comprehensive guide to becoming the best version of yourself,1894,

&nbsp;

And one of the most common things I see is people struggling with developing and improving themselves because of a lack of self love.

&nbsp;

When it comes to self love, most of the advice I see being given out is in regards to the physical development. Working out, eating healthier, doing what you enjoy, mediating, etc. However, I barely see any suggestions on how to develop self love in regards to the mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the self.

&nbsp;

I'd be interested in sharing my story with developing self love, and how I was able to overcome deep rooted depression through tackling all forms of the self, and to truly learn how to love myself and overcome all my nervousness, anxiety, low self esteem, low self value, and overall negative outlook on life.

&nbsp;

I'd also like to share the practices that got me over my issues, and helped to develop myself to the person I am today.

&nbsp;

So I'm interested in knowing if anyone would like to see something like that shared here. I'd post 4 separate posts in respect to all four aspects of self love, giving detailed examples and methods to implement in order to develop each. 

&nbsp;

You guys interested?

1ey147c,"So, a lot has been going on lately in my life, and one of them is getting a new job as an international student, not to mention the research position at my university AND my regular classes AND gym AND Guitar practice. Balancing these things has become so cumbersome that some days I just want to be left alone without talking to anyone. But something miraculous happened when I started waking up at 5:30 in the morning.

At the start, it was really difficult and made me miserable. I snoozed my alarm a lot of times, which resulted in me missing my buses and trains, which had a chain reaction of me getting late for work and having some issues with my job.

Recently, I went to the bookstore and laid my eyes on the book Morning Miracle, which said that the author changed his life after getting up just half an hour earlier than usual, so copying his method, I did the same.

I got up at 5:30 sharp, and followed the following schedule:

1. 5 minutes of journaling
2. 5 minutes of drinking water, in peace
3. 5 minutes of meditation
4. 5 minutes of push-ups
5. 5 minutes of looking at vision board

I found that after following these basic habits for 21 days straight, I got my performance in my job to a new f\*\*g level—not exaggerating. When I walk down the aisle, I feel as if I have taken compound V. I can feel the air hitting my face differently, and I am more focused and have the mental stamina to go through my day and still have energy for myself, I tried to rationalize this by stating that this is the placebo effect, but no, things have been \*ACTUALLY\* different for me.

>Starting your day in the solitude best assed in the morning will help you retain the focus you need to optimize your daily tasks

A special mention I would like to give to mindfulness practice: I used to get overwhelmed easily, and my mind would do a mental throw-up after my job. I eventually had no time left for people who actually mattered to me, and my relationships would suffer. I have observed that:

>After meditating, I can take tasks one by one, instead of juggling between several ones, which significantly drains out your mental capacity. My focus remains on the thing I am currently doing and the rest fades away

The first thing you should be doing in the morning is controlling your cortisol, the fear hormone, which is a significant contributor to mental fatigue- To control this, do the following:

>Reflect on your present blessings — every man has many- State down 3 things you are grateful for and practice solitude

After you’re done with this, embrace the elephant in the room and write down the most important task you want to finish, followed by others in descending order of importance, This will help you finish the tasks which contribute to 80% of the outcome while minimizing low-priority and fulfilling tasks which could have been finished with a little mental capacity and focus

Finally, give some time to outline and work on things that can help you increase your current knowledge related to your work or life, because hey, no one is a loser when they continuously improve themselves and learn a thing or two every day. Besides, if you do get a professional online certification, there will be a sweet promotion waiting for you at the end of the current year!

Aim to sleep till 10 p.m so that you can start your day at 5 or 5:30, This practice will help you take advantage of the solitude and tranquility of mornings to optimize your body, soul and mind",r/getdisciplined,I started waking up at 5:30 everyday -Here's what happened,1894,
1l10v5v,"Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to adapt and reorganize by forming new neural connections throughout life. This means that the brain can change its structure and function in response to repeated experiences, learning, thoughts, and behaviors.

Simply put, when we repeat an action or thought, your brain gradually creates neural connections that increasingly facilitate that behavior or thought. When we constantly repeat negative thoughts or beliefs like ""I'm insufficient, I'm a failure,"" the neural networks that sustain them strengthen, making them more automatic and difficult to change. This is the root cause of low self-esteem—they're just bad habits. Then, confirmation bias develops. That is, your brain pays special attention to behaviors that confirm your belief, ignoring other possibilities like ""I made a mistake, but that doesn't make me a failure.""

Now, what does this have to do with procrastination?  Well, every time you avoid a task, ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" your brain registers that immediate relief (escaping the discomfort).  The neural connections that link the task with ""danger"" (stress, boredom, fear of failure) are strengthened, while those linked to disciplined action weaken. In other words, the more you procrastinate, the stronger that association becomes, and the harder it is to break out of that cycle.

You have to constantly repeat REALISTIC (non-toxic) positive thoughts, even if you don't believe them at first. Over time, your brain will begin to believe them. Phrases like ""I am enough just the way I am"" or ""I'm not perfect, I'm human, and I can make mistakes"" are the first step to gradually changing your brain's neural networks.",r/getdisciplined,"When I discovered how ""neuroplasticity"" works, my life changed",1875,

go24t7,"Stop saying ""just get disciplined."" Seriously.

It's completely useless. We are here because we don't know how to be disciplined. Many of us have mental issues that make it hard. ""Just get disciplined"" is about as useful as ""just stop being sad."" I've seen this ""advice"" here time and time again, and I cannot emphasize enough how destructive it is. 

When discipline is something you've always struggled with, you've probably always TRIED. You've probably always made the attempt. It's just, you've failed every time. If someone tells you to just ""do it,"" it becomes ""well I TRIED EIGHT TIMES"" and you start thinking you just CANT do it. If it's as simple as they say, why can't you do it? Why can't I do it?

Because it's not that damn simple. If it was, this sub would consist entirely of a sticky with the Nike logo and ""just do it."" People here need actual advice on how to retrain their brain to become disciplined. This can be through many techniques, including ones I HAVE seen mentioned here - CBT, focusing on health, even medication is the answer for some. But it seems whenever someone posts some advice, it's met with multiple comments about how you don't need any of that, you just need to ""get disciplined.""

THAT IS NOT ADVICE. It is not helpful. It is not useful. It's not that simple, if it was, no one would be here. Thankyou for coming to my Ted Talk.",r/getdisciplined,"[Discussion] Stop saying ""Just Get Disciplined.""",1841,
